0,Bad customer service. Staff are very impolite and rude,"Used national rail twice and on both occasions I found the staff unpleasant, unfriendly and incompetent. Wasn't helpful in regards to platform information and general customer service skills."
1,Pretty awful service,"I phoned National rail to find out why several trains had been cancelled to Brighton, none of the advisers spoke English and told me to check the website. Turns out they cancelled a load of trains just because the train guard didn't show up, meaning many people were stranded at Southampton Central, including myself who had a plane flight to catch early the next morning. Southampton Central is easily the worse run station ever, they seem to cancel trains all the time for absolutely no reason then give you stick for attempting your journey another way or tell you try again tomorrow and merely shrug their shoulders when you ask what is going on. I have also witnessed a member of public being verbally harassed by one of the train guards when she was desperately trying to get home but they cancelled many trains for absolutely no reason. Seems they all want to go home early and stick their feet up."
2,Awful staff,I travel from Brokenhast to southampton central without a ticket because I was running to get the train and didn't have time to buy one! When we arrived in Southampton i explained to the staff there what happened I apologise and asked them to buy a ticket from and show this to them. however the staff were awful to me and take all my details (even my place of birth) and asked me to pay a fine of £20. I had no problem paying the fine but the man you was talking to me was sarcastic and treated me like a criminal and really unfair! If the people there can't be HUMANS then you should't give them a job that requires human communication every day!!
3,Very good,Saved about £50 on a single trip using NationalRail to pick specific trains that are inexplicably cheaper than the surrounding journeys. It's easy to use and looks good. Very good!
4,Check it out.,I always use the national rail enquiry site when planning a rail journey.  The site allows you to find the quickest route and the cheapest fare. It also has up to date information on travel disruptions.
5,Oh no! There is always a problem!,"The website always has a problem. You can look up one journey, head back to the main menu put in a new journey and then up pops up ""Oh no! There's been a problem"". Crap website."
6,Terrible communication from staff st…,"Terrible communication from staff st Stockport train station. They announced the next train on platform 2 was the 10.16 to Bristol temple meads. But it wasn’t. It was the delayed Norwich train resulting in Huge amount of inconvenience and delays impacting me, my colleagues and customers. Well done everyone at Stockport station this morning. Total incompetence and disregard for the customer."
7,Cancellations due to heavy snow? It’s not snowin!,"Snow hits Britain..Trains were running ok in the morning then at night when there’s not a single snow flock left, they are all cancelled due to heavy snow...what snow?! People responsible for this excuse are damn stupid, wanna cancel trains for whatever reason? at least come up with an excuse that’d make sense..something believable. Snow melted away by midday, it’s now 21:30"
8,The Worst Company In Britain,"National rail is the worst company in Britain. In other developed countries trains run regularly and on time and the company cares when things go wrong. In other developed countries trains are quick and comfortable. Not in Britain. I am currently sat on an already delayed train which is pointing in the direction of Brighton but hasn't moved for the past 15 minutes due to a 'problem'. We have been given no other information nor how long we expect to wait. This is typical of the British railway system and I am in no way surprised; it is second nature for me to factor delays into my journeys now. One positive is that there is no need to worry about missing your train in Britain as they are always at least 5 minutes late, and often closer to 15. I am now stood on the platform of an unknown station after being kicked off the train to Brighton which was deemed unservicable, and I am still not surprised. The price I payed for this third-world service was appalling and the price of trains in general means it is often cheaper to fly to your destination via Spain or Ireland, as well as quicker, easier, more reliable and more comfortable. The entire British rail system is a national disgrace from head office to the 'service' itself. Someone is currently locked in the toilet of the unservicable train and as a result it cannot move to make way for the replacement. The temperature is minus 3. I wish I had slept at Luton Airport until the busses recovered from the horrific two-inch snowfall and resultant traffic chaos."
9,Christmas got cancelled - no refund,Worst customer service I've ever received.
10,Worst in europe,"Useless website, poor service"
11,Left phone on train..,Left phone on train... national rail guard / inspector found.. answered and returned phone... the phone had money.. bank cards and pins all in the case and this trustworthy guard handed it back to us. He went out of his way to return it and wouldn't accept any money or reward. Absolutely amazed that there are still decent people out there... this was a train from east Croydon to Tonbridge tonight. Very proud to have genuine people like this work for our national rail
12,b@stards charge £330 to get from London …,b@stards charge £330 to get from London to Manchester! i paid less to travel around Switzerland for three weeks. Don't even understand hows that legal.
13,Grater Anglea British rail customer …,"Grater Anglea British rail customer service is bad. The online site must take money from people without the phone app everyday as they chose this option for you on a continue page, misslead you by asking for your name  that you can not use to collect tickets. If you do not request refund straight away, and I don't know what if any you get back, they refund nothing even if a ticket is not used and you bough another."
14,Poor website design,Poor website design. Give a chance to some competent person to design a proper site for 2018!
15,Another trip from London king’s cross …,"Another trip from London king’s cross to kings lynn without a seat. This is the 7th time in 6 months at different times of the day that the train service is inadequate. People crammed into carriages, all squashed on top of each other. To bad. This time even I felt ashamed that this was all we could offer as there were a group of foreign tourists who couldn’t believe it. Shame on national rail as this route has been just like this for years! ☹️"
16,Unreasonable pricing,"When booking a train for what was a reasonable price, the site 'crashed', upon reloading all the trains I was booking double in price. Appalling, I wanted to go home and now I can't even afford to do that."
17,Not to be trusted with your journeys,Not to be trusted with your journeys! Cambridge to London is probably one of the worst routes they serve.
18,Do not trust.,Could be much better keeps showing different fares for the same journey. Do not trust what you are seeing.
19,Oh no! It's the National Rail website!,Every time I go on the site to try and get train times I get the pathetic 'Oh no' message about the site having 'technical difficulties'. Utterly dismal and amateurish.
20,Todmorden to Huddersfield,Todmorden to Huddersfield. ...afternoon journey is a joke. Late trains / no trains. For the last 3 weeks....
21,Just received the most outstanding …,"Just received the most outstanding customer service experience I have ever had while visiting the Guildford Railway Station! I used one of the counters (because I am not too familiar with ticket types) to buy tickets for my friends and myself and the gentlemen, Alvaro saved a huge amount us money for us. He was very kind and explained what kind of further options we have rather than a normal travel card. Thank you so much again Alvaro!"
22,Had a train conductor with bad attitude …,"Had a train conductor with bad attitude ( who I've seen have attitude with other people before) have a go at me and my mum for not buying our tickets before we got on the train,  we explained there's no ticket office and only 1 ticket machine which doesn't work. I had my railcard and debit card ready to pay.  She wasn't having any of it. Next time I see her I'll take her name and report her personally for being rude."
23,Always breaks down,Always breaks down. Honestly one of the worst websites- embarrassing really.
24,Shocking day out,"Instead of having a 40 minute journey, I had a 1 hour 30 minute journey due to someone jumping in front of a train which caused two cancellations. These were not made clear and the three staff members there were sat on a bench with their arms crossed. Then the train took a further 10 minutes than stated to get to the platform which also was not made clear. By the time the train finally came at 11:57 I didnt think it was still morning, I thought it was at least sometime in the evening, if not sometime next year."
25,Bought a ticket online,"Bought a ticket online. Regular price was £28.50 but buy it now for £15.90. Bought the ticket after taking ages to pay for the ticket as the web page kept saying invalid email address. Got home and printed the ticket out only to realise that the departure time was different to the one i had paid for, meaning i have to pay the original price. Not the first time ive had problems on this site. Totally useless site and costly"
26,It could be so much better.,"I do not understand why people are leaving negative reviews on the National Rail page, for complaints against specific journeys and the service received from specific journey providers (such as Northern Rail,  Transpennine Express etc (TPE)). National Rail are not responsible for those, only the services they themselves offer, such as timetables, purchasing tickets etc. If you have a problem with Cross Country trains, surely you complain to Cross Country and leave a review on the Cross Country specific page?!"
27,First class greater ambellio is …,First class greater ambellio is actually a joke. I have travelled from ipswich to torquay. First western first class was amazing! The 1st  leg was massively disappointing. No difference to standard seats or facilities
28,London Victoria Information desk worker rude and unhelpful,"Really disappointed with rude and unhelpful information desk worker at London Victoria outside platforms 1-5 (today at 19h). Surely the job description explained you'd have to talk to people. Every person I saw talk to the man, came away more confused or perturbed, whilst I waited for my train. Only glad I didn't have to speak toto him. A training course in customer service? How this man has a job when so many people are unemployed I don't know. Such a shame, every other member of staff has been delightful with all my dealings with national rail."
29,Impossible to buy a Travel Card on line …,Impossible to buy a Travel Card on line 3 days ahead. Keeps throwing to Southern Rail who dont recognize the final DLR destination. So whats the point- perhaps to pay the full price on the day at the station then....
30,Last week my family and myself …,"Last week my family and myself completed our return journey from Birmingham airport to Newport south wales comprimising of: Birmingham international to Birmingham new Street - Birmingham New Street to Bristol Parkway and Bristol Parkway to Newport. Having had a poor journey to Birmingham international 14 days previous due to ignorant unhelpful platform staff at Newport and Birmingham ( At Newport they were more interested at sitting in there cabin than helping) we thought that things could only get better, how wrong were we. Well lets start at the beggining: After arriving via the shuttle to Birmingham International at around 8.45pm we could find nobody to ask what platform we needed for a train to Birmingham New Street so we had to figure it out ourselves via the info screens. Having arrived at Birmingham new street we spotted a platform guard so we waited for him to dispatch the train and asked him for the platform we needed to catch our train to Bristol Parkway well he was very rude and told us he did not know so we would have to use the info screen upstairs, what chance have we got of trains running smoothly if he did not know what train runs from what platform?. Having dragged our luggage between us 5 adults and 3 young children we figured it out. Arriving at Bristol Parkway we asked the platform attendant for the right platform for Newport expecting the same attitude as the last guard but to our suprise he was extremely helpful giving us the info we needed and helping us with the lift and pointing out that we could use the waiting room pointing out that we could turn the heaters on as we had over an hour to wait but then came the bad news the train was delayed due to signalling issues. Once the train arrived the guard was very helpful and helped us board the train as we had 6 pieces of luggage. Once on the train more bad news was announced "" Due to signalling issues we had to do a detour that would add around 45 minutes to our journey "" just what we did not need.We arrived at Newport at 02.15 instead of 01.27. Will I use the railway again NO NO NO Expensive but useless"
31,I have recently visited the UK from …Australia,"I have recently visited the UK from Australia with my son,sister and mother who is 88 years old. Although my mum is in fine form for her age, we required a wheelchair for most of our travels around the UK and London."
32,Redesign your website,National Rail needs to fire all people responsible for their web design because it's one of the most badly designed websites you can come across.
33,National Rail issues,"Whilst usually I find national rail journeys good, there have been several occasions on south west trains where the service is unsatisfactory!"
34,It is one of the worst and most unreliable service seen,"They will not inform you of any changes and when they say look at their website for update it, they only update much later on after they made changes after weeks , and when they say they offer rail replacement, they are either late or don't even show up!"
35,Useless,Absolutely terrible website. Ridiculous prices
36,train conductors are scam artists,"After presenting and asking two members of the on-board team if I had the correct train for my ticket I got comfortable ready to enjoy my what should have been a quick, quiet journey home. Instead the conductor who I'd previously spoken to refused my ticket and made me purchase a new one. After explaining I simply couldn't afford it he explained I could be fined very loudly infront of everyone I felt so embarrassed. I was told no discount would be given even though I have a valid government card. When I arrived at my station which was seconds later I was furious so went to the information desk where I was told it was my own fault no complaint or refund will be handled. If you can get to your destination an alternative method I would definitely use it. It will be less stressful and properly won't have to pay twice."
37,Isn't possible to review them with 0…,Isn't possible to review them with 0 stars?!
38,Better out there,Found cheaper deals at redspotted hanky
39,very uncooperative,"Got delayed on the tube journey and missed my 10:20 train to Manchester. I explained the situation and asked to be let onto the next train at 10:40 (same price tickets both off peak, train was half empty as it turned out) - was told this train is more expensive (which was a lie as it turned out), made to buy new ticket by a very smug looking manager. For me as a student was quite a lot of money and felt very very unfriendly (we'll make you pay to make a point). Hope they've enjoyed my £50 and imagine just how nice would be to get the same money from them every time the trains are late.."
40,Bad bad bad.,"Replacement service between Royston and Cambridge has a long que, not enough buses to accommodate customers. And rail officers picking random people of the back of the     que to be first on bus. Advice to anyone try not to use rail replacement service if you are aware it will occur.  Lack of information on service whilst in que as to where bus is heading further services etc."
41,Delayed Ticket Information and horrible service!,"My experience with National Rail was god awful! Firstly I received no ticket information from them after purchasing a ticket, so I called them up and then got it sorted, I tried to make a point that it was not fair that i had to receive the information half an hour before the trains departure, so I was redirected to the Team Leader Becca, who then firstly gave me a snide attitude for asking for compensation or even a proper explanation for something other than ""System fault"", and then also talked me while literally giggling. How is this right? The fact that they treated me like dirt when they messed up my ticket."
42,Disgusting service,"One of the worst train companies I have ever used in London. Rubbish, never on time service. Delays and cancellations on a daily basis or every two days. Always experiencing delays due to some reason. No processes in place to fix service quickly and effectively. I would not recommend this service to anyone visitin London. Utter rubbish. Wasted hours of my life waiting for delayed trains and cancelled trains. Always over packed trains."
43,No complaints,"We used National Rail extensively during our week-long stay in London. It was convenient & provided great connectivity. Most of the times, we had no difficulty in finding seats either."
44,Ticket purchase for someone else???/ Ridiculous,Recently my Girlfriend wanted to buy me a train ticket so that I could go and visit her that day. As I had very little finances at the time I gladly accepted and waited for her to get back to me with news that the ticket had been bought. To my astonishment she called me and said that she was unable to buy me a ticket as I'd need the debit card used to make the online purchase in order to collect it from the Self-collection Machine. How ridiculous! My partner wants to buy me a Ticket and she can't because I NEED HER DEBIT CARD to collect the ticket.
45,Query on ticket bought on line,"The customer service man was extremely unhelpful.  We bought my sons fiancé who is a student, a ticket on line with our payment card as a treat so she could visit and didn't think about her having to have the card with her to collect the tickets.  The man said that there was nothing that could be done and she would have to purchase another ticket - surely NR can do something in these situations rather than take £70 of our money for nothing!!  Disgusting!  The unhelpful rude man didn't even give us any clear advice."
46,I hunted for a review site just so I…,"I hunted for a review site just so I can share how much I despise National Raill. We pay all this money in the uk, especially London to travel day to day to work, school runs etc and yet we get this absolute ******** TRASH excuse of a what they call a “service”. Blatantly lie always saying there was a faulty train absolute bs it’s just them giving us this **** service and making excuses for the disorganisation. Without fail! I’m telling you without fail like clockwork there are multiple cancellations and delays every single ****ing day!!!!! I’m just amazed as what they like to call a “first world country” like this they can’t even offer a good dependable service for the outrageous prices we pay.  Honestly who ever is in charge of running this “service” needs to give it a rest, just retire cause this ain’t for you. If I date minus stars I would! They are lucky minimum star rating is one they don’t even deserve the dirt of my shoe. NO ONE DEPEND ON NATIONAL RAIL CAUSE WITHOT FAIL THEY WILL LET TOU DOWN. I’ve had free services which perform better than them! The ones in charge of this “service” should be ashamed of themselves and quit!!!!"
47,A total nightmare!!!,"The most disgraceful, useless and totally incompetent Train Service anywhere in Europe."
48,I have never had a time where the…,"I have never had a time where the trains have ran smoothly and efficiently for me. I am always 30mins up to 3 hours delayed. So dissapointing, and the new train designs are not worth what they were paid for. !!!"
49,Always cancel always delayed never…,"Always cancel always delayed never travel in your time. I'm gonna lose my job because of this. They make announcement sorry :) im sorry, if you can't do probly just close...."
50,Bad bad bad sort yourself out .1 July…,Bad bad bad sort yourself out .1 July 2018 .abroad can do why can't we .
51,Not Good,During last week I renewed my Disabled Rail Pass for £20 using my debit card to find National Rail has debited my account twice with the same amount.  This has now reduced my bank balance to 99p so am unable to purchase food for the weekend as like many on low income live from hand to mouth.
52,dire And disgusting joke of a service,I don’t want to give a star at all.
53,Disabled assistance,Today I have travelled by train for the 1st time as a disabled passenger I'm in a wheelchair at present and I cannot fault the staff at all neither at burton on Trent or Birmingham new street so helpful. the service they have for disabled passengers is great.
54,They break their own terms of use,"They break their own terms of use by not responding to complaints emails within 20 days. Will be taking this matter to the ombudsman, the FCA and other higher governing bodies"
55,Deplorable service,"We had been waiting for an 11:30am bus since 11:15am, right in front of the gate. Before we knew it, the doors had been shut in our faces and the bus departed. As we are not from the UK, we did not realise we had to walk out amongst the buses without any direction, and where we are from you usually board at the ticketed time. There was NO final boarding call and no indication that it was boarding (no sign, no people around the bus etc.)"
56,Id give less than 1 star if I could,"Id give less than 1 star if I could. How can any company take so many people's money and just say ""this service is cancelled"".  YOU ARE ABSOLUTE CRIMINALS. we pay a fortune for absolute crap with you"
57,No trust ....,08/June / 18
58,This is a mixed review based on…,This is a mixed review based on different criteria.
59,Unacceptable website,"Unacceptable website! National disgrace but they don't care, won't even read this review."
60,Always Terrible,"Always Terrible, worst communications in the business. Also how much do you charge for tickets?"
61,I use the app daily,"I use the app daily, I just wish that the app would reflect when the trains get canned and go from another station"
62,Misleading website,"I booked a first class ticket on a specific train (traveling to an airport, so which train I got mattered) and the website instead gave me a standard class ticket not usable on the service I had booked. The rail company refused to accept responsibility blaming nationalrail.co.uk. The website is either misleading or fraudulent, substituting a completely different ticket for the one requested without any indication that this was possible."
63,Timetable and booking information unable to access,The UK has the worst national rail service Farcical new summer timetable hasn't been finalised which starts middle May 2018 so unable to research times of trains unable to book trains for late May early June 2018. So much for the standard 12 week advance search now not even 8 weeks as of 31st March 2018.
64,Extremely rude and unhelpful staff!!,Extremely rude and unhelpful staff!!
65,"Air conditioning broken, pre-ordered breakfast not available","The air conditioning was broken on my outward journey. According to the attendant it had been broken for some time and he wasn't very pleased that it hadn't been fixed yet despite his pleas to higher powers for this to happen. I endured a very uncomfortable night during which I was either very hot or, having taken the covers off me and after the temperature had dropped, very cold. I woke up in the morning with a sore throat and hoarseness, and my voice hasn't recovered even now, 10 days later. I can only think that the reason it wasn't fixed in a timely manner has something to do with the fact that the trains are soon to be replaced. On one leg of the only other journey I have made with Caledonian sleeper, there was a problem with the ventilation which meant we had to sleep with the doors open to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Presumably some suit in an office somewhere decided it would be a shrewd business move to spend money on advertising the new fleet of trains, rather then rushing to ensure that customers have a comfortable journey in existing trains that will soon go out of use. No refund was offered for the lack of air conditioning."
66,Railcard users beware,"Railcard users beware, Caledonian Sleeper have decided to no longer honour senior and other discount rail cards when you book their twin berth cabins. They claim it is because of the new trains - actually it seems to just be a convenient revision to their booking rules to extract more money from their passengers. The website gives the impression that the discount has been applied when booking - but it hasn't. Very disappointing behaviour."
67,Falls well short of expectations set by the marketing - VERY POOR!,Poor experience from start to finish. The most impressive thing is the marketing!... the experience falls well short of this.
68,Ok but not great,"Decent service if you want to wake up in the centre of London.  Do not expect much privacy though, the staff knock on your door and enter without your permission about 2 seconds later!"
69,Excellent Service,Just travelled up and down to Scotland on the sleeper and the staff and service has been brilliant. You get woken up when you want (for me after the train has arrived so you get as much sleep as possible) the beds are comfortable and there is plenty of room for luggage on board.
70,Caledonian Sleeper,I try to get up to Scotland maybe once a month as it's home and I was hoping to take my dog north with me this weekend but booked without checking that they'd charge £94 for her to travel with me.
71,Forgot our 2 together rail card,Forgot our 2 together rail card.
72,I was getting the 16:33 train to find…,"I was getting the 16:33 train to find out it was cancelled so had wait around till 17:33 to find out that was delayed for 16 minutes to see only one coach train came. Had to stand in the middle of the train in this heat with about 30+ other people this didn’t feel safe, when trying to get off the train had to slide down the train pushing in to other people and struggling to get off the train which resulted in me nearly missing my stop. I just think if they cancel a train they should at least realise that they need a bigger train as a lot people had to wait for the next one I would rated is 0/5 stars if I was able to I won’t be travelling with them again."
73,Vile customer service,"The poorest customer service I have ever experienced. Around Christmas 2017 a female instructor insisted I spent £35 on a new ticket from Sheffield to Nottingham even though I could clearly evidence I had purchased a specified ticket for the train I was travelling on. She was rude, disparaging and aggressive in front of other passengers with no appreciation that other passengers could hear her shouting at me. To top it it off when I complained they never provided a refund even though, again, I had confirmation of my purchase. Absolutely vile company, which I will continue to boycott through using other train services and booking tickets through alternative company sites. They should be ashamed to have workers like this representing their company."
74,They took money from my bank account…,They took money from my bank account mistakly and never refunded! they stole money
75,Reserved seats but were taken up by…,Reserved seats but were taken up by squatters who refused to move claiming that the train staff gave them permission to sit anywhere they wanted. So what's the point of advance booking with reservation?
76,three hour delay with no clear…,"three hour delay with no clear explanation why... a full refund is only the bare Minimum that should be offered, for arriving at 11pm when you should have been there by 8pm"
77,Worst company ever,"Worst company ever, not only the train was 50 minutes late but we received no information from the staff at the station."
78,I use this company most days,I use this company most days. Like everything else you can get delays and cancellations but all in all I find the service ok. The staff seem friendly enough also. The tickets can do with being cheaper and less over crowding
79,My daughter paid for first class for…,"My daughter paid for first class for her return journey after flying from Florida.  Got on the train at St Pancras and there was only water on offer.  No tea, no coffee, no snacks. She was so hungry and was desperate for a cup of tea! Absolutely appalling. Travelling on her own, she couldn't leave her things to go in search of a buffet car.  They take the first class fare but do not offer the service.  How do they get away with this? We went first class with Virgin trains and it was absolutely fantastic.  At service food and drinks and the first class lounge for the return journey was  wonderful with ample food and drinks available and on the journey itself we had sandwiches, biscuits, drinks etc."
80,Rip off merchants!,"As a regular First Class traveller with this train company, I am totally brassed off with how they're allowed to get away with charging First Class ticket prices whilst not providing First Class service. For example, I travelled from Leicester to Derby last night (27 Apr 18) on the 22.03 service. It was announced at Leicester station there would be an at-seat service on the train but did I see one? Of course not! There were five female members of the on-train team stood in the area at the back of Coach G laughing and joking for the entirety of my journey and none of them attempted to serve refreshments in First Class or even check tickets."
81,Awful,"I booked a train for 10am online the day before my commute as it is a lot cheaper but there was a technical problem and it booked the 7pm train. After I booked it and realised, I went on there again and filmed my booking process as proof I was not making this up and it showed there was a technical error and it was redirecting me to a different train time that I originally selected. When I rang East Midlands and explained it to the man on the phone he told me I was lying and the website wouldn’t do that, so I offered to email the video over as I needed to get on my train for work. The man on the phone gave me a fake email, and he also told me it would take 3 days for them to reply to me. So no matter what this wasn’t get resolved, he told me I had to buy another ticket which was £90 now as the tickets had gone up and there was nothing they can do about it. Even though I had proof this was not my fault and it was there website, he was rude and couldn’t care less that I had to get to work. I couldn’t afford to buy another train ticket so I’ve lost a whole day at work and had to pre book the train for the next day as it’s cheaper. Overall this was disgusting customer service and they couldn’t care, and they’ve lost me a days pay and now I’ve had to pay two train fares as well."
82,We use East Midlands Trains on a…,"We use East Midlands Trains on a regular basis, the service is always brilliant and if we do get stuck their Twitter team comes back quick."
83,Total dissatisfaction for a 1st class experience,"Extremely disappointed with the 1st class experience. Old and dirty carriages, no trolley service and the guy serving the buffet bar has zero customer service skills! I asked a question about the menu, he just shrugged his shoulders and shook his head! Didn't have a clue.. never again complete waste of money. Not a patch on Virgin!!!!"
84,I called there Web support service team…,"I called there Web support service team up to cancel my ticket, as i have made other arrangements for transport to luton airport. Following a big surprise that there is a big admin fee of £10 just to cancel a single ticket."
85,Really disappointing service...,"I visited Lincoln station today (23/02, 19.20) to go to York. I had a problem with my tickets and I asked the lady on the desk kindly to help me as my train was about to leave."
86,Dire,"Dire.  Absolutely dire.  Ancient trains with uncomfortable 40 year old seats.  Other train operators have fully refurbished their similar trains but not EMT.  Just shove some new fabric on a 40 year old seat and its fine.   First class is a joke compared to other long distance operators.  The First Class lounge at St Pancras is appalling.  Clearly done on the cheap.  Tiny, over crowded, often dirty and unattended with a poor selection of refreshments.   I now drive to Grantham or Newark to travel on East Coast wherever possible.  Often cheaper fares and first class rail travel as it should be."
87,I use the trains a lot and this must be…,I use the trains a lot and this must be the most appaling train comp in the country. The on board staff were fine but appeared to be struggling for infomation and to support their employers.
88,Filthy carriages,"Filthy, old first class carriages with no trolley service both ways. This company needs to learn the real first class experience from a well know east coast operator."
89,Joke of a train provider,"Use them often unfortunately as there's no other viable option. Constant overcrowding because they don't put enough coaches on is a weekly occurrence. They apologize over the tannoy....why not just manage it properly?! Always book a seat only to be told ""no reservations"", when there are reservations it's so overcrowded it takes 30 mins to work your way to your seat. Avoid if possible! Travel with other providers such as virgin with no problem."
90,£180 to be shipped like cattle,No option to reserve seats but restricted to the train booked. No seats - £180 for my wife and I to stand/sit on the floor for over an hour.
91,Not worth £50 upgrade,"Seeing on their website that upgrade to 1st was only £20 we decided to opt in. The host was a star and service from a trolley was good, Internet was great."
92,What a ridiculous setup,What a ridiculous setup! Everyone rushing to the train midday Saturday to find nearly all seats electronically marked as reserved with nobody in them. Perhaps they will be charging for people sitting together next. Also charge for WIFI.
93,Horrendous customer service and…,"Horrendous customer service and organisation at Virgin Trains, from Euston Station."

95,Crap,Crap in every way
96,No compensation for a delay over 1 hour,"Used Virgin trains on Friday night which was delayed  by 22 mins which meant I had to wait an hour for my connecting train. Despite me buying the entire journey through Virgin train the compesation response said it was ""fair"" and ""consistent"" that they didn't compensate as I the train was less than 30 mins."
97,Paddy & Michael,"I used the Liverpool Lime Street to Euston train service last week and cannot fault the service that I received. Very many thanks and compliments to Paddy and Michael, the train managers, who were superb and treated me like royalty."
98,Never use this train service again !,"Never use this train service again !! On the train now from London Kings Cross to Arbroath, we paid over £400 that’s including our rail cards for the 3 off is for our journey- the train was so overcrowded- we were unable to reserve a seat for our 6 hr Journey- then even the ailse were so packed with people - even outside the carriages by the toilets were full with people - we had to stand by the toilet for our journey which stunk !!!!! Surly this has to be a health and safety issue ?? Totally disgusted on how we were treated - and spoken to by some of the staff....... anyone looking at using this service “FORGET IT” I’m going to make sure this is posted on EVERY social media page 😡"
99,Yet again virgin train is late,"Yet again virgin train is late , a later virgin train arrived when mine should of , but because I’d bought an advance ticket I could not use this train which was going to the same station . Last"
100,Unfair pricing,Terrible pricing. I bought a ticket for £20 and to change it to the one 15 minutes earlier to ride with a friend required me to apparently get a completely new ticket - for £80. We travelled separately just to see how empty the trains were. Terrible corporate feeling with unfair pricing.
101,Consistently poor,"Regrettably I use Virgin trains a lot for work, commuting from Kings Cross to various parts of the country. The outward journey is usually ok, however when returning back to London in the evening, I have not once been on time. The delays and long pauses are consistent with Virgin Rail. By contrast contrast when I have travelled with Midland Railways, no issues at all. Try to avoid Virgin!!!!"
102,After cancelling my train and the one…,After cancelling my train and the one that was supposed to be an alternative  train I was told by a virgin employee when I complained if you don't like it don't go by train
103,My honest opinion on travelling on the…,My honest opinion on travelling on the virgin train from Newcastle the Staff were so lovely on the virgin train that i got from Newcastle to Edinburgh very accommodating and polite helping me find my seat and the food was lovely a lot of room to sit back and relax I would definitely use this service again.
104,Used there trains a couple of times…,"Used there trains a couple of times from London to Manchester, never had any delay, but their wifi would cause any ones hair to fall out, and the fact you need to purchase this on an expensive trip such as this, would make you think twice about what kind of message they are saying with this."

106,Had the misfortune to travel 3 times…,"Had the misfortune to travel 3 times with this company and every time I have been let down. Most recent was travelling to Liverpool Lime Street from Shrewsbury with a change at Crewe. Unbeknown to myself Liverpool were playing Roma at Anfield on the day I travelled and being disabled I am unable to stand for any length of time despite the fact that a seat had been reserved but was unable to use it. Virgin train dispatchers are rude and insensitive to people with mobility issues, the final straw being oh well if you had arranged assistance in advance we could have helped you. Having done this on previous travels with this company where assistance was conspicuous by it s absence or so grudging that you feel as though you are a nuisance. Sadly, I'm due to travel to Blackpool to a conference in a weeks time and guess which train company I've got to make do with, yes Virgin again."
107,Terrible response time/no answer to my question via email,"I sent an email to the customer service department on the 23/3 to ask how to reserve a train seat on my return journey from London on the 11/4 while travelling for a month through Europe. Initially, they claimed it would take up to 15 days to respond, 45 days later I received a response saying they had a large number of emails to process. I received no information or help from the company."

110,Virgin what has happened to you?,"A very bad experience with Virgin staff who were less than helpful. After waiting 2 hours in the freezing cold station at Glasgow where actual snow flakes were coming through the roof our train back to London Euston flashed up cancelled. I asked the Virgin staff what should we do and the only advice given by a truly fed up female member of their staff was to download their train app and twitter for live updates. When asked but we are now stranded the female shrugged her shoulders put her arms out and said frostily ""nothing I can do""! We were ""abandoned"" for 4 days without an offer of them finding accommodation, food or drink.....yet they had a duty of care which they failed dismally to provide. Their tweets advised each day that trains would leave Glasgow yet when you looked on Euston they were ALL cancelled and I had to tweet them to say their live updates were in fact incorrect. We discovered by mere chance they were starting to bus passengers from Glasgow to Carlisle where trains were now running ....this information was on Teletext but not Twitter! So the following morning (day 4 of being abandoned) we drudged our way down to the station in the snow at 7.00am without breakfast or a hot drink. We expected a notice to advise passengers we expected a member of Virgin staff to be on hand but there was no one! I had to ask the ticket sales manager who advised connection buses were laid on yesterday but Virgin staff didn't want to make it public as they would be unindated instead it was by mere chance if passengers found out.....shocking! This was infuriating to say the least as we could have got home a day early saving the added expense of a night's accommodation, food, drink not to mention our 2 dogs who had been stuck in kennels. The bus turned up shortly after 8am and we were ushered on to it. No provision of hot drinks or food which could have been provided by Virgin as nearby food outlets were open. We travelled to Carlisle station where on the platform there were a handful of Virgin staff in a huddle keeping their distance from the passengers. We had to approach them for advice. We purchased our own drinks + food from the nearby kiosk but again no offer from Virgin despite their passenger charter of providing refreshment and food where possible....well it was possible! On the train to Preston the buffet car was shut due to passengers sitting on the floor....the train was rammed. We had to change at Preston to catch another train to Milton Keynes. And it wasn't until we had just left Birmingham that food was finally provided.....unfortunately no hot drinks as the boiler had broken! It has taken 55 days to get a reply to my complaint and to be reimbursed for accommodation only apparently on this occasion they are not reimbursing food and drink....How do they expect us to be stuck with a bill out of our control whilst in their care?! I might add I had to chase the reply up on numerous occasions .....online chats as Virgin obviously don't have human beings that can talk on a phone! Managers were apparently always in meetings leaving their staff to front the online chats and some not very successfully either. I was constantly being promised a reply with 10 working days....5 working days....by the end of the week.....oh you will receive it by next Wednesday as our printer for the cheques has broken! Fobbed off big time and to think a big company like Virgin only have ""one"" printer to print the cheques....yeah right! The letter was a standard reply which lacked empathy or sincerity for any remorse regarding our stranded situation. They barely apologised. So why did it take 55 days to reply? Their website states 28 days which again they clearly failed like their trains. Would I recommend Virgin trains ""No""!"
111,Always late. Hopeless handling of compensation claims.,"Utterly hopeless handling of the doubtless thousands of lateness compensation claims. They said that I was on a different train to which I was on (which was ironically also late, but not quite enough for compensation) and even though I proved to them that this was wrong they then ignored several chase emails for days. Next I'll drive, or go a longer route to avoid Virgin."
112,No replies to repay delay,"The problem I'm having seems to be quite a common one according to other reviews I have just read. The repay delay system is absolutely dreadful, I have only received the usual automated replies, no solution or refund with regards to a delayed service. I have now been waiting for approx. 8 weeks and that's just for a reply, not good at all."
113,"The ""ticket sale"" has started and my…","The ""ticket sale"" has started and my attempts to get my ticket to Liverpool are thwarted.  I don't have a choice of times, so even on the cheaper rate I will be paying almost £200.  And they don't mention that,actually, Liverpool station will be closed, so I have no idea where I will be getting off."
114,Our train was cancelled in February and…,Our train was cancelled in February and we had to stand all the way back on another train.  I'm sure they do this on purpose to save costs as half the trains that day were cancelled for no good reason.
115,Repay Delay is an absolute joke!!,"My train from Birmingham New Street was cancelled due to mechanical failure.  The conductor on the train told me about Repay Delay - what an absolute joke that is!! I applied a day or so after I got home on 12th March, sent photo of my tickets, filled in online form - I've heard absolutely nothing except automated replies when I chase, which I have, about 8 times -  Its not that its a huge sum of money it really isn't - its the principal, they promote this service because you have been inconvenienced, then don't pay up!!  It took me FOUR hours to get from Birmingham to Harpenden Herts, which should have taken no more than 2. I've just asked on Messenger for an address to complain to and she's given me Customer Resolutions which is the exact same dept who DONT reply!!  When I asked for a postal address, she advised that if I write to complain it will ALSO go to the Customer Resolutions Dept."

118,Very Poor!,"I regularly travel from Newcastle to London and there is always something wrong. Whether it’s the ultra slow WiFi that isn’t working, no card machine, no trolley service and the list goes on!"
119,Terrible,My 3rd Feb train from Manchester to London was cancelled its now April and still chasing a refund. Customer service never responds. Chased 5 times now.
120,Traveled first class from Leeds to…,Traveled first class from Leeds to London on 12-45 train. Couldn't fault it staff were wonderful
121,"Will not pay compensation for delays, just completely ignore you","Had a serious delay months ago and claimed compensation, despite repeated attempts they never respond to your messages. Very poor customer service, but I guess that lines the pockets for this monopoly provider."
122,Unprepared for Easter Travel,"For a princely sum of money (£90 return) travelled to North Wales from Euston. Started with major herd like rush as platform announced 8 mins prior to departure. Overcrowded train , no leg room , one toilet out of use, the other stunk of vomit... Cheers Richard !"
123,This company is a joke,"Me and my boyfriend had to use Virgin to travel to Edinburgh. What got me first was the fact, that even tho Virgin has their own internet service, 3rd class only has 15(!!) minutes of free internet. I'm not originally from the UK and all the trains I've travelled with in Europe had always free internet. For how expensive Virgin's trains are, I'd at least expect that. Our train got delayed on our way from Edinburgh to Newcastle, due to ""cleaning"" the train, well they put those reservation tickets on the seats but train was still full of garbage from the previous passengers. Train arrived 20 minutes late and we missed our train from Newcastle to Sunderland. Was told we could get the next one, problem was the same line was due in the next hour and we didn't want to wait. Their customer service boot was closed for some reason so we tried asking the lady at the tickets place, if we could get a refund, she said, obviously annoyed, we'd have to do that at where we bought them. Needless to say, I'll try my best to not travel with this company again."
124,Very Unhappy customer !,Very Unhappy customer !! If only there was an alternative from Manchester to Euston !
125,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL EXPERIENCE WITH VIRGIN TRAINS!!!,I gave one star because I couldn’t give - 5!!!!
126,How do u deal with a company that…,How do u deal with a company that missells train tickets and then doesn't answer e mail's or phones the complaints system is a joke. Used to use all the time but will use the other services that go to Wales might be slower but at least they don't treat you like rubbish all answers welcome
127,Off peak,"Are peak, off peak and super off peak times CLEARLY and UNDERSTANDABLY stated anywhere at the station or online?"
128,Truly appauling 2 hour delays refund a month late,"Truly appauling, both to and from edinburgh to london were delayed over 2 hours, my unwell girlfriend and i had to sit on the floor on the way back. This was February, i am still awaiting a refund. It would seem it is wholely unviable as a service, and unfortunately virgin, as an operator, are grossely inept."
129,I am writing this review to say how…How brilliant the staff are at Lancaster Station,I am writing this review to say how fantastic Lancaster Station is.... The station is an absolute pleasure to travel from.... It's one of the best kept and clean stations that I have been to...The staff are so helpful and polite. The customer service is absolutely first class.One person that people comment a lot about is John the lovely man who keeps the station looking so spick and span.Virgin are very lucky to have someone so committed on their team. Thank you to the team for making the start of my many journeys very pleasant.Looking forward to the lovely hanging baskets and pots this Summer. They always look really great and cheer all the commuters up...So well done to the team at Lancaster....Thank you and keep up the good work!!
130,The Virgin Trains sales-person at…,The Virgin Trains sales-person at Euston Station was rude and ignorant.
131,the seat sale that finished yesterday…,the seat sale that finished yesterday was an absolute con!!!! tried booking several times over weekend from manchester to london only for the website to not let you book any seats at the advertised price saying these were not available
132,Why do you put your customers through this?,I haven't reviewed very much before and do not leave companies bad reviews. But our experience of trying to get a refund for a train that was cancelled due to the snow is appalling.
133,Poor service,What a joke virgin trains are travelled from Edinburgh to Warrington understand because of the bad weather trains were disrupted but no working toilets no hot drinks and no communication from staff why we were stuck for over 2 hours baby had to be changed on table left a bag on train no response to e mails phone calls or messages will try and avoid using them in future
134,I recently purchased online tickets…,"I recently purchased online tickets from Peterborough to Kings Cross for £98 for the 09.03 and 17.49 expensive but needs must however having arrived at Kings Cross at 17.46 the board in front of the platform was not showing train details so did not know which train to get, hence train left without me so had to catch the 18.03 as my tickets was advance single I was told I have to buy another ticket...yes £54.40 later. Virgin customer relations are simply terrible they show no compassion or are in any way reasonable. I had paid for a Virgin East Coast train and at a peak cost I was not trying to fare dodge or de-fraud the company but they show no interest in customer relations. I am someone that has used Virgin East Coast regularly up till now. I shall not use them again and will look into legal action and writing to my local MP"
135,Worst customer service,"Had one of the worst experience ever using a service. There is no different from other train companies, apart from being worse and a rip off. Me and my wife ended up paying £380 for a journey from Milton Keynes to Edinburgh on second class for the pure fact that the website was very confusing when tickets were bought."
136,Difficult to love,Virgin Trains are one of those frustrating companies who make themselves difficult to love. They could deliver so much but what they do deliver comes so short of the expectation.
137,Travelled first class on Friday 2nd…,Travelled first class on Friday 2nd March from Crewe to London on the 13.15 departure from Crewe.
138,Virgin customer service????,"We were due to return from a short break in Edinburgh on Thursday 1st March but due to the weather this was not possible which we totally understand. However, what followed is unbelievable in the 21st century. We eventually managed to get a train back on Monday 5th March as they had been cancelled until then with no alternative offered other than a refund of our ticket.Trying to contact Virgin is impossible and have to rely on social media for regular updates. We have emailed several times but just get the automated response and here we are 7th March and still heard nothing. We are out of pocket by almost £300 for further hotel costs plus the cost of meals etc. We were obviously not the only ones as lucky to keep our room. At least our hotel understood customer service."
139,Virgin trains disgusting level of cleanliness,Virgin trains - instead of wasting money on stupid annoying voice messages in toilets trying to be funny when not; invest the money in something new like cleaning them? Or you could redesign them so they don’t spill urine on the floor and make your Pendalinos smell like a cattle truck. Or use the money to go to Gemany or Japan and ask how they keep their trains clean. Just a few ideas for you.
140,GOOD,"never had a bad journey on virgin trains and i use them a lot, if you go on the trainline.com a few weeks before your journey you can always find bargain offers on trains. First class is excellent."
141,Purchased a return ticket for a journey…,"Purchased a return ticket for a journey and paid for the tickets to be delivered. The journey was split with a change at Derby so I should have received four individual tickets for each leg of the journey, only received three. After contacting was informed that the person making the journey would be required to go to a ticket machine to obtain the fourth ticket. This was not suitable as I purchased the ticket for my partner so firstly, she would not have my bank card (required at the machine) nor would she be able to use the machine hence my payment to have the tickets delivered. If I wanted to or was able to use the ticket machine I would have done so for all the tickets. Escalated the call to Virgin Trains and was told a supervisor would call back within 24 hours, no one called. Second time was informed someone would call back within 72 hours, no one called. My only alternative was to obtain the missing ticket from another train company so now I have paid twice for the same journey. Less than happy with this awful service from Virgin Trains."
142,"Awful, awful company","I have already posted a review about how awful Virgin East Coast are but I have now found out that Virgin West Coast are awful too. During the snow disruption I travelled from Preston to Carlisle with them. The train was announced and shown on the board as going to Glasgow, but as soon as the doors were closed they announced it would be terminating at Carlisle because of the snow situation further north. There were people who would not have got on that train if they had been told this originally. They were all simply dumped at Carlisle and told that they'd have to wait there until the line re-opened (which was being measured in days rather than hours), or go back towards London. There were no more hotel rooms available in Carlisle, which is quite a small town. I was travelling across the country to Newcastle so I was not directly affected, but I felt so desperately sorry for all these poor stranded people. I sat next to a quite elderly  lady who had joined the train to Carlisle because she had been told by Virgin staff it was going on to Glasgow and was now having to travel to Newcastle just to find a hotel room. There is no way that Virgin central command, wherever that is, did not already know that the line to Glasgow was blocked, but their customer service is so routinely appalling that they didn't feel it necessary to share accurate information with the public, let alone make any attempt to help people who were stranded. From now on I am only travelling with Transpennine. And there is no way I would ever buy any other product from the Virgin empire, because the sight of their logo just makes me feel sick."
143,Always on time,Always on time. Staff are always nice and the trains clean.
144,Very overpriced and overbooked,"Very overpriced and overbooked. Luckily we showed up early enough to grab a seat, but the hallways were crowded for more than half the train ride making it hard to utilize the lavatories."
145,very appalling customer service,"very appalling customer service - took me 5 days to get hold of a human and the lack of interest is unreal. i left my laptop under the table in first class at the back , i tried to contact immediately but as i say took 5 days, if i could have got hold of someone i would have got my laptop back. The disinterest is unbelievable,"
146,Appalling company,Appalling company! I have had reason to complain on more than one occasion for awful service. The latest complaint was by letter which has been ignored for several weeks now. Will not use this company again!
147,"Too expensive now, go busses 1/4 to 1/3 the price",Doncaster to edinburgh is a three hour journey. It was impossible for me to book in advance
148,Sack Tilly and Sandra,"Bought ticket from Ledbury to Birmingham and received the email confirmation on my phone.  No problems on the journey there - happily accepted by the conductor.  Coming back from Birmingham, I was refused entry minutes before the train left by two obnoxious Virgin staff - Sandra and Tilly.  I was told that I had to go to the booking office to get it printed.  I was the shouted out by Sandra to do as I was told.  Tilly meanwhile interrupted me continuously and told me sarcastically that ""she made the rules sweetheart.""  I objected and told her not to patronise me and Tilly told me she would call me whatever she wanted.  Truely despicable Virgin staff who should be sacked."
149,I use the train from Manchester to …London,"I use the train from Manchester to London most weeks, travelling first class, and I find the staff to be friendly and courteous. On the 9.35 am train on 9th February 2018 I was treated rather unpleasantly by a member of staff called Paula. We all have bad days of course!!"
150,RIP OFF!,RIP OFF!
151,Virgin trains you are just complete rubbish and your customer service is a joke,Just before Christmas. My girlfriend and I booked a train to Scotland through the Virgin website.
152,Left stranded and they didn’t give a damn !,"Disabled gentleman, wallet lost, refused to check cctv as lost at Wolverhampton station, they could have prevented an opportunist picking it up."
153,Nightmare train with drunk people,"I don't even know where to start, we boarded the virgin train from Kings cross/London to newcastle on 23.12.17 at 8pm."
154,Trains were stuffy and hot,"Trains were stuffy and hot,  reservation system didnt work as there were double bookings.  Wifi also doesnt work...take your car instead"
155,Completely terrible experience,"Completely terrible experience which shattered the peace of a nice holiday in Windermere when we travelled back to London earlier this week. Disabled passengers not helped--and therefore complaining to everyone--, dogs on seats, collapse of reservation system, overhot and crowded trains, and not a guard to be seen, although a 'first class upgrade' was apparently available, announced just after fellow passengers discovered that the food in the on-train bar had run out. Will never travel with Virgin again if I can help it. I now discover amongst friends online that they won't travel in this country because it involves using a Virgin train. We need to nationalise them as soon as possible."
156,rip off,"9 out of ten staff rude stuck up unhelpful,also after cancelled trains haveing to get coach travel with young kids and all the upheaval i complained only to be offered first class return journey which i never did need i paid for a ticket i never used i payed extra for coach travel from euston to victoria with lots of luggage pram etc extra food as the journey via coach trippled compared to the train time yes things happen but at least they could offer to reimburse me money not a ticket they dontknow if i even need which by the way i never did need so yeah rubbish service and rudeness all because there train goes the fastest but we all know manners customer relations is not there good point sort it out please"
157,I would like to say a big thank you to Helen,"I would like to say a big thank you to Helen who works for virgin trains at Newcastle station, we made a mess of booking our trains from Durham to Edinburgh the week before Christmas  and as a result 3 of our party were changing in Newcastle station and 1 was booked direct from Durham. To cut a long story short, she arranged it so we could all travel together. She was friendly, efficient and made a difficult situation 100% better. It is easy to find fault with the train services but it is such a pleasure to deal with helpful staff and they should get the recognition they deserve. Keep up the good work Helen, we will look out for you again when we pass through Newcastle station."
158,Customer service and staff are very …,"Customer service and staff are very rude! The trains were / lines were under maintenance so we had to get the train from kidsgrove to stoke-on-trent then to Manchester while we were on the virgin train to Manchester after already paying for our ticket they tried to charge us again and said our tickets were not valid we got treat like scum my partner was in floods of tears it was a special day to get wedding stuff ruined and now they are basically saying training will be given and hope to you use our service again, I would rather walk poor service and I hope people use other services than virgin trains!"
159,Not so amazing is the follow up to my …,Not so amazing is the follow up to my last review.....THIS IS EVEN WORSE.
160,Still can't believe this experience.,My mother is poorly. Partner books train. Train strike. Try to get refund from Virgin. Cue 'cruel and unusual' like punishment and vindictive staff attitudes. Thanks for the strike before Xmas! Thanks Virgin! Just don't attempt to use their call centres or get reasonable advice at train station. Time for a new company running this Service.
161,What a terrible customer service,"What a terrible customer service. Not a one single reply to two messages I sent over two weeks. I am trying to get my refund but no one is answering me despite I already applied for a refund two weeks ago. I now have two tickets for the same journey. Never again, will stick to Trainline as I used to before. I will not book a ticket from Virgin ever again. Worse customer service ever!!!!!!"
162,Virgin App is rubbish I’m afraid 😡,"Compared to others, such as Arriva Trains Wales, Cross Country, Northern, Virgin compare well. HOWEVER, the more I’ve thought about it I realise I’m using the wrong measurement by comparing them against really really bad."
163,Manipulative and pathetic company,They happily take your money and con you. Worst train line worst company. Both the train and tv and internet branches all rinse you. If you like been conned out of your money use virgin trains.
164,194 pounds simply for a forgotten …,"194 pounds simply for a forgotten railcard? You gotta be joking me cntt? Apparently not. There's some absolute dckheads who do ticket control. They want either that or for me to pay for another railcard. I've already paid for two fucken railcards, I've not slept last night and this has pretty much fked up the rest of my trip. Virgin trains, not so virgin since they fk the hell out of their customers. I'm never travelling w/ them again. Top that with train delays makes for an extremely bad trip."
165,Branson sells magic beans,"I loathe virgin trains with a passion but due to government ineptitude and lack of oversight I am forced to use their shoddy half baked service,"
166,Lovely conductor,Had a great experience on the train from Newcastle to London today. The conductor Shaun was extremely helpful and understanding.
167,Neil and Mohammed in customer services …,Neil and Mohammed in customer services have provided exceptional customer service. Through my own stupidity I left my tuxedo on the train and thankfully due to there quick response they managed to track it and get it back to me within 1 hour! Exceptional service thank you so much
168,Virgin trains are a disgrace....on my …,Virgin trains are a disgrace....on my way to Manchester today from London Euston. 45 min delay due to a staff member not turning up and the carriages are so packed that I'm sitting on the floor freezing my butt.
169,Thought we’d treat ourselves to first …,Thought we’d treat ourselves to first class train with virgin. Went into lounge no coffee - not a good start !! Oh & train late 😫
170,Disgusting trains,"Disgusting trains, bad odour, creaking. Definitely not quality in travel!"
171,I booked a return train journey London …,"I booked a return train journey London to Sheffield and noticed I booked the wrong train home because the website is so awful to use. I called up and they said I need to rebook in order to get a refund for the old ticket. So I did this and put through a refund request online. Heard nothing for ages. Called them and they told me I have to send my other tickets back - fair enough, but when were you going to tell me this exactly, if I hadn't called????"
172,Poor attitudes.,Poor attitudes.
173,Disgusting customer service,"Disgusting customer service. A couple of months ago the machine did not print my dad's ticket - the Virgin staff at Birmingham new street instead of coming to the machine and helping told him to simply buy a new one at a different machine - why should he buy the same ticket twice??? Today my mobile app ticket wouldn't download and again the new street virgin staff told me to buy a brand new ticket or call the customer services line to sort it out (""the sooner you stop moaning and call them the better"") - I was 16th in the queue and my train was in 10 minutes. Seems like a massive scam to make people buy the same ticket twice and of course it's more expensive on the day of travel when I had already bought these tickets in advance to be cost effective in the face of rapidly rising ticket prices. Disgustingly unhelpful, rude and patronising staff, so unexpected given that virgin are supposed to be known for their customer service."
174,I travelled to York the other day and …,"I travelled to York the other day and when did Virgin Rail decide to stop giving you free tea or coffee in First Class? Really poor service. I expect more when I pay for First Class Tickets. I was travelling with a family member who's disabled so I was unable to leave my seat. I would have thought Virgin would look after their customers better, especially those with disabilities. I feel its more about cutting their service to increase their profit margins, than putting their customers first and giving them a first class customer experience."
175,Horrendous service even before travelling,"Back in 2004 Virgin Trains were fabulous and I’d only ever had great experiences with them, however recently the communication & service has been appalling."
176,Lost property,Accidentally left a backpack on a train yesterday and have been trying to track it down to no avail. All the customer enquiry numbers send you round in circles. It’s an emergency as my car keys are in the bag.
177,Dreadful Service - Constant Excuses,No matter when you travel with Virgin something seems to be an issue. £277 for a first class ticket this morning. Board a train at 6.55am and we are advised there are no hot drinks for a 3 hour journey. This is because the hot water failed a health test. That is disgusting.
178,"Treated like CATTLE, do not travel on weekends",Don't travel on there trains at weekends because they over book them and you can not get a seat even if you have reserved one!!!this happened to us from a train from Scotland to London on a Sunday we ended up having to stand for over 1 hour outside the train toilet!!.The Virgin on train staff  advised that due to tech issues and Rugby matches and people on the train from cross country should not been on.SO they blamed everyone else but themselves !!!!.
179,Virgin trains are absolute shiiit,"Virgin trains are absolute shiiit. Bet Branson couldn't give one either. Still, least I've paid for a few gallons of high octane for HIS tax free jet. And I bet that wasn't delayed for 2 hours . Suppose it don't matter either if he then misses his connection cos he can just use HIS tax free private helicopter. Oh and just to top it all, I was once again treated to one of Richard's special standing seats all the way. Thanks Mr Branson you're great."
180,Just terrible,"Just terrible. Advertised a ticket at one price then couldn't sell it to me because of a technical glitch; made me buy one that was double the price and write off to their customer service where I would ""definitely get a refund"".. two months of emailing and calling and getting told I was in the wrong place... just totally, totally incompetent. Finally got my money back two months later."
181,fantastic experience..i have taken this …,fantastic experience..i have taken this so many times from London to Manchaster..really efficient.
182,I book a trip from Liverpool to London …,I book a trip from Liverpool to London from Australia for the 25AUG17 with Virgin Trains in JUN17.
183,Paid £25 for first class upgrade but …,Paid £25 for first class upgrade but refreshments staff were abrupt verging on the rude and the hot drinks were TERRIBLE. On top of this a dreary 4.15 hour journey London to Leeds.
184,By all means go on 1st class but NOT ON WEEKENDS!,"We travelled from London Euston to Preston (Lancs) in first class on the weekend.  NEVER EVER buy a 1st class ticket on a weekend or Bankholiday this is because they will try to con you. First of all you pay around £90-£150 for a oneway fare 1st class and all you get is a muffin, cup of tea and a banana. Not 1st class standard at all. The lounge itself has a very poor selection of food but has a coffee machine and a few flapjacks. No Cerial or toast or pastrys of any kind. So if your on the first train of the day like I was you dont expect a full breakfast buffet. EAT before you leave."
185,I travelled on a hot day in a broken …,I travelled on a hot day in a broken air con compartment that was told had broken before the train set off !..no room elsewhere..i have written to virgin
186,Appalling service.,Appalling service.
187,Just been refused entry onto a Virgin …,Just been refused entry onto a Virgin Train to Euston from Stoke-on-Trent the train manager explained I wasn't allowed on the train as I bought a cheap ticket the train was empty I will now not be home till 1 in the morning or as this way I could've been home at 11 o'clock.  Totally awful customer services where a company could have bought some Goodwill instead they have a customer who seething I understand there's rules are in quite happy to pay the extra bloke just will not let me on the train
188,Virgin east coast poor,"Unfortunately, I have had to use them since September 2017 weekly. Punctuality is very poor: usually just under 30 minutes late. Although, asked for a delay repayment for a 50  minute delay 3 weeks ago, the form has disappeared. Was over an hour late yesterday with no seat: I think they cancelled my train to save cost after we waited on the platform at Doncaster for an hour or so yesterday evening(5/11/17). The don't pick up the phone (15 mins and counting(18.55 6/11/17). The loo's are variable. Today(12/11/17) stuck in doncaster 45 mins. Apparently, engineer enroute...and now a replacement train enroute! However, the website and apps look great!!  Good to see the priorities in order. Still no news on first claim over 3 weeks ago."
189,accusing disable person and no responsibility,"on 15 August 2017 I had a ticket from London to Hull,when I arrived to Kingscross station 20 min before departure, because I am vision impaired and I have a Guide dog,I found one of the staff and asked for some help to find my train, she didn't know which platform I have to go ,so she went to ask from another colleague ,however she stopped and start to talk around 5 to 10 meter away from me about someone else and I could hear it clearly, so I had to try to find another staff to get help because i didn't want to loose my train,eventuly i found another staff again ,and ask him for my train, after a few min she came to me and told your train is not here yet, and i asked her you mean the train has delay? and surprisingly with a rude action she told me I don't know, just it is not hereafter a few moments the announcement in kingscrross statin announced my train to HULL ,,and i said but my train is here, and i asked for some assistant to get my train and with a polite language told her you don't need to be rude, suddenly she answered about what i did for you , you must appreciate me ,once again she said to me I MUST APPRICIATE HER..it means she tried to put me down because of my disability ,I answered her ,what did you do for for that i must appreciate you and she tried to shout at me ....I said you have no right to talk to me that and i want to talk to your manager now..she answered we have no manager here..go to what you want to do..I have got panic attack and anxiety and i am taking medication because of that at the time ,my body start to shake ,and i asked i want to ask assistant to catch my train..another colleague of her which was a guy ,without knowing whats going on there threat me he wants to beat me and told me go find your train by yourself...my panic attack got really bad and 2 or 3 police officer came to take care of me ,,even they wanted to call ambulance ,at the time i had very bad situation ,she was ( the first member of staff) staning and walking around me and talking loud around me to make me worst abut my situation .because of this behaviour i missed my train and i had to wait 2 hours for next train."
190,""" Thank you for traveling with Virgin …",""" Thank you for traveling with Virgin Trains!"" That's the announcement at the end of every journey to and from London. Well...your welcome but it's not like I had a choice as you have the monopoly on the route. Still cant get my head round how this franchise system is good for the consumer but he ho back to Virgin. For the price of an all inclusive week end break in the lakes for 2 you can travel to London in 2 hours. Your tickets are always checked with a smile and the cramped seats are ok as long as your not sat next to somebody larger than average. For the price of an All inclusive weeks holiday in Europe you can travel First Class unless you book 4 years in advance and travel 14.11 precisely :)"
191,Poor today,"Poor today , 7 hours London to Edinburgh , not 4 hours 20."
192,Do not bother with 1st class rip off!!,"One star is one too many in my opinion! One day between trains and a completely different experience in the second. The first journey provided great service tables set out, hot food choices, wine available as well as soft drinks and the staff couldn’t do enough for us. When we boarded for the second leg we were abruptly by one of the onboard staff members who firstly advised we were in the wrong place (I wasn’t as I booked and paid a fortune for anytime) and then rudely advised me that as I had boarded an earlier train than originally planned I wouldn’t have my pre reserved seats. I understood this but I paid a lot of money for anytime as I knew my plans were likely to change and did not expect such a rude response.  The next thing is the choice of a wrap (very nice if you like spicy food) my mum doesn’t or alternatively what equates to a cheese spread sandwich. We asked for a glass of wine with our food and were told that wine is not served on a weekend but we could purchase it from the bar!! Really?? We had it on a Friday and we could buy it from the baron we wanted alcohol so why not serve it within the extortionate price of a first class ticket???? This is ridiculous and certainly not consistent with the choices delivered on our journey the previous day. In the end after paying £762.00 I went to the bar and paid extra for refreshments and hot food for this sector of our journey which takes almost 4 hours of our total trip. Very disappointing after the excellent service and choice offered previously......absolutely disappointed and surprised at the lack of customer care."
193,Absolute SH*TE,"Absolute SH*TE! Useless website, inundated with utterly pointless links and no actual helpful information. Weekend trains take a hour longer with no explanation why. Can't reserve a seat modification if you make it that far on the booking process. Trains are always under-stocked and delayed. Tickets are hideously overpriced for the service provided and if your train is delayed and you make a claim, chances are they will try and worm their way out of paying you the refund you're entitled to."
194,Amazing train service,"Amazing train service! I've read some of the reviews on here and 9 out of 10 seem like such nit-picky complaints. I've never had any issues with Virgin Trains. Friendly staff and comfortable accommodations. They understand what privatisation should mean, by providing cheap fares to compete with London Midland in the South and Transpennine Express in the North and Scotland. If only they and Stagecoach were awarded all of the Franchise contacts in England."
195,Don’t believe that they let you have your preferred seats....!!!,I travel every week on Virgin......but beware they say you can reserve seats that reflect you preference and also that there is a way to change the allocated seat. My preferences are recorded as 1st class individual seat facing direction of travel......for the last 10 weeks i have been allocated a backwards facing seat at a table of 4 and there is no way the system will allow me to change the system.
196,VIRGIN TRAINS CUSTOMER SERVICE !! Racist and unhelpful,Cant believe that i was ridiclued and called a racist in directly for wearing a red poppy by a member of the platform team at kings cross then she was very unhelpful regards the turnstiles..will never use virgin trains or products
197,Booked 1st class tickets for my wife …,Booked 1st class tickets for my wife and I Newcastle to London. Stewart took dinner order. After 2 hours no food. I complained then the steward said its coming. Never did when I complained just before arriving the steward said we have had no chef on the train you should have opted for sandwiches! Made a formal complaint but had to harras for a response. After 2 months  eventually got a response which said food is complimentary in 1st class and not part of the ticket price! Completely ignoring the fact that we had not had any food for more that 4 hours but had been led to believe it was on its way. Abmsmal customer service come back North East Coast operator 100% better than Virgin. They should have their licence suspended
198,Regular virgin traveller several times …,Regular virgin traveller several times a week from MK to Macclesfield. Sometime first class depending on which customer . This evening I met Micheal a virgin ticket inspector . Well done Micheal you have just wreaked virgins customer service record with me .
199,Following a previous mess up by virgin …,"Following a previous mess up by virgin I was given some free tickets to claim. I sent the email, as requested and nothing has happened. Been hanging on the phone for well over 5 hours in total."
200,Coventry to Edinburgh and return,"Coventry to Edinburgh and return. Train journey itself was good, albeit delayed.  Cafe service, though, abysmal on the return journey."
201,Again using ancient East Midlands …,"Again using ancient East Midlands trains on the Leeds - Kings X route. No seat reservations, very noisy. Customer Service is a joke. The train service taints the entire Virgin brand."
202,Issues with two together,"Travel to Manchester often and always use virgin as there are no other choices - is there was competition I wonder what the levels of customer service would be like?! Bought a two together travel card which didn’t arrive prior to journey, went to the office to explain and the answer was you need to buy another two tickets as you don’t have the phycial copy.. I would rather a digital copy but was not clear how to get one nor was the assistant. In the end have bought two extra tickets that I’ll have to go back and refund, pointless transaction and wastes my time, virgin need to think about the customer experience and not what’s easier for their processes."
203,I buy a first class ticket to get a …,I buy a first class ticket to get a first class service. Sometimes  this is non existent  with  no beverages  or food being available. It is part if the service most the time and this encourages me to purchase a first  class ticket  when on business. When it is not available it is  so annoying and complaints have been raised. My argument is if Virgin can't offer a full first  class service then we should be able to switch  to a second class ticket  and refund the difference. Is this not a fair option. I could  save money doing this and at least  know im only going to get a seat with nothing else.
204,Appalling Customer Service,"Virgin Trains customer service rates as the worst I've ever experienced in my entire life. I've never before been driven to post such a review, but they've pushed me over the edge! The last three occasions that I've travelled on Virgin - both East Coast and West Coast - have resulted in delays of 45 minutes, two hours, and 40 minutes."
205,First class ticket was taken from …,"First class ticket was taken from London to  Birmingham abt it was a great trip. Pleasant staff, clean, food better than expected. Only one trip in a sea of 1 star ratings, but all good for me!"
206,Unhelpful and inflexible,"Took a Virgin train from Lancaster to London Euston. I boarded an earlier train, as there was an industrial dispute on my line connecting into Lancaster. When the ticket inspector looked at my ticket, I had to leave the train, as I the rules were that I could not board earlier than the seat reservation time. This is despite the train having ample vacant seats."
207,embarrassing company and extremely …,embarrassing company and extremely overpriced for the quality of service.
208,First Class - it is not!!!,Not First Class by any stretch of the imagination:
209,Wifi mostly didn’t work for 3 hour journey. Excessive air con for Sept,Cons:
210,"Don't use, and if you have to, reserve a seat","I used Virgin trains for the first time this weekend. I didn't reserve a seat because on the train companies I usually use, this is either not possible or not necessary. Not so with Virgin: both trains I took were fully booked, which means that out of 8 or 10 carriages, there is a single one with non-reserved seats. This is obviously not enough for all the people who turn up without a reservation - either because they weren't aware that it is necessary or because they couldn't know in advance which train they would be able to take, or because they missed the one they had reserved seats on. (Virgin charges you for changing a reservation, apprently.) In consequence, I had to sit on the floor outside the toilet for 2 hours, with many fellow-sufferers. The worst thing about this was the smell from the toilet - the chemical disinfectant is so strong that it makes you feel sick when passing the toilet on the outside, let alone sit there for any length of time..."
211,This company is ridiculous,"This company is ridiculous. My company paid a 1st class weekly pass for me to travel from Birmingham to London everyday as I am 8.5 months pregnant. Within this week not even 1 train was on time and I mean with serious delays of more than 20-30 min each time. Today, I even had to stand for half an hour (and Iam heavily pregnant as I mentioned earlier) because many trains were delayed and they had to put everyone in the same train. So basically I did not sit for half an hour, did not get a compensation for my travel because I had a weekly pass and was not given even an apology. Discrase."
212,My operator of choice,I have used them twice lately and found the service excellent. My operator of choice. Far better than my local service.
213,Very clever pricing,Very clever pricing
214,Ridiculous excuses given for less …,"Ridiculous excuses given for less number of carriages when they could have attached a few coaches from a standby depot. Birmingham to Glasgow.. They don't care about compensating . All they say is ""sorry"" a million times in the announcement which makes your ears go deaf. On top of poor service they annoy you with horrible announcements. Sorry is not going to convince people. I would have preferred to see some action to have taken place to compensate the passengers. The data connection drops very often (the enhanced data connectivity message is a joke). Their adverts on how they are better over car journeys make me cringe.. its pathetic.."
215,They charged me for two journeys.,They charged me for two journeys. It took four phone calls and numerous emails before I got my £150+ refund. And they had the audacity to charge me a £10 admin fee for my refund.
216,Careful of Aaron in 1st class,"Don't be surprised if you get very poor service and cocky attitude by Aaron who works in first class possibly on the London Euston to Glasgow service. Management generally will also brush it off. Be particularly wary if you are of a brown or yellow make and model. My advice would be to deal with it on the spot yourself, as virgin are not bothered by the bad reviews and generally have a monopoly on some routes. Bon voyage."
217,Do not use virgin trains!,I booked a virgin train ticket online but had to use the London Midland website because the virgin website kept crashing at the payment screen. When I got to Euston to collect my ticket from the machines there was a software problem so I could not retrieve my tickets so I showed a virgin customer service assistant my receipt and explained my circumstances but he refused to let me travel insisting I had to buy another ticket at a cost of £33. He was extremely rude and condescending and I had to go home and come back the next day and pay to travel again at gross inconvenience. I contacted virgin and they took a month to reply only to offer me a half price ticket for my next journey taking no account of the aggravation and cost I had endured previously.
218,Exceptional service,"Travelling on Virgin First Class between Crewe and London.  Old carriage pretty full with only one service person.  The reason I am leaving this five star feedback is because of him.  I am sitting at the back and have watched him serve for the past hour non stop.  I travel with virgin a lot and most servers can't really be bothered past the first service round, this guy just kept going.  Absolutely brilliant guy.  Name badge says Soo.  Give him a training role please !"
219,waiting 19 mins so far on 3rd call to …,waiting 19 mins so far on 3rd call to ask why I can't get the ticket to my mobile.
220,Please please DO NOT give your hard earned money to virgin!!!,"Please please DO NOT give your hard earned money to virgin!!!! Booked a well deserved trip to Brighton with my daughter-1st class as a treat after both my parents dying within 11weeks of each other. No 1st class exists on a weekend- apart from extra leg room seats!!!! No where does it say this or make you aware when you are booking! Only found out after reading reviews. Virgin website says its limited at weekends & bank holidays, LIMITED!!!- what a joke, coffee or tea & a horrible bun & an Apple or banana!!! & bottle of water!!!.  On returning home from Brighton, we needed to use the London underground, the lines we needed were delayed & it was advising people to use different routes, I was on my own with my daughter & not familiar with underground etc. We ended up missing our train at Euston.  I went to 4 different virgin desks at Euston, kept getting passed around to be told I would have to buy new tickets. If I wanted to travel straight  Manchester now it would cost me £200! If I went a very long way round which would take 4hours (normally 2), it would cost £60, I was getting very scared & upset as on my own with young daughter, I was very distraught &  was crying very much, I asked why I had to pay again when it wasn't my fault about the underground, to which the reply was its not our fault either! The male who was serving me was very rude & arrogant & mad  me feel very degraded! I sed I didn't have extra money, he sed get someone else to pay!!!! I asked -who- This  man next to me in the queue- he said yes ask him, he was smirking all the time he was talking! He then sed I will check price for last train tonight-midnight or one for tomorrow!!! I said I don't want to do that, I'm with my young daughter- he said not my problem, I had to tell him to get someone else to serve me  as he was so  humiliating!! Even the guy getting served next to me said he wants reporting- his attitude is appalling,. I have never felt so mistreated & made to feel so low , stood their in tears. I had to end up paying £60 to get home ( which was 9pm) should have been  4.40pm. Oh & his name was BILAL!!!"
221,Never again,"Was the first ride. Was first class, and shall be the last one ever. I speak for myself only, Virgin Train won't get a single quid from in the future."
222,Virgin trains are terrible to travel …,Virgin trains are terrible to travel with.  Although the acknowledged problems with nasty smells from toilets since 2013 they have not appear to have fixed the problem. So every journey and I travel a lot is an unpleasant experience.... I wish I had a choice to use a rival company and avoid that revolting smell...
223,New  east coast web site pants!,New  east coast web site is very poor -they have stopped sending email confirmations with booking code to get tickets. I worked out how to get the calander from my account but the booking reference in the calender entry is not the booking code for tickets!
224,‘Virgin trains’ are Monopolists and they do what they want!!!,‘Virgin trains’ are Monopolists and they do what they want!!!
225,Paid  £360 for return from Glasgow to …,Paid  £360 for return from Glasgow to london 1st class. We traveled on a bank holiday so a very reduced 1st class service that consisted of a damp cold sandwich and cup of tea. Virgin were still advertising '' up grade to 1st class'' even though it was a reduced service. What a con. At time of booking we were not told of reduced service. Have complained direct to Virgin but customer service is as bad as 1st class on a bank holiday. !
226,Virgin trains' lack of common sense,Sept 2017 updated review:
227,Mean old Virgin trains,"Mean old Virgin trains - they have lost my business forever (I travel twice weekly between London and Birmingham) after I left my phone at home and had to go back to get it (because my advance ticket was on my phone) and told me I had to buy a new ticket. Staff unhelpful and unsympathetic. And the Virgin trains toilets are horrid. Am changing back to London Midland, which takes longer but kinder when you make an honest mistake."
228,VERY UNHAPPY!,VERY UNHAPPY!
229,Virgin Train 1st Class not the experience they boast about,"Booked my first ever 1st Class ticket with Virgin trains. It was definitely not worth it. Breakfast was similar to that served in a hospital. A lady came around with trolly, only having cold toast and porridge. She made no apologies for not having the promised 1st class warm breakfast.   The train was dirty and rundown. An experience I would not recommend. Very disappointed."
230,Terrible customer service- don't buy …,"Terrible customer service- don't buy your train tickets from here, they are very unsympathetic and unwilling to help with problems you may have."
231,DIGUSTING TREATMENT OF DISABLED PEOPLE,I AM TRYING HARD TO BE POLITE IN DESCRIBING  VIRGIN TRAINS AS THE WORST COMPANY ON EARTH WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING OR ASSISTING DISABLED PEOPLE .
232,Customer service without even asking for any!,My daughter and I recently returned on a Virgin Train West Coast route from London Euston. The train was very overbooked and we voluntarily disembarked before the train left the station—deciding to wait until the next train we could take on our tickets (an almost four-hour delay as our return tickets were off-peak only).
233,Full refund for an 1 hour delay,"Travelled from Preston (lancs) to London Euston, great train, but a technical error delayed us for an hour. The info given was great but what really surprised me positively was that my friend and I, 3 days later were refunded our traintickets totaling 189 pounds..wauw what a service:-)"
234,Always delayed  from Crewe at 16:12,I take Virgin train from Manchester Piccadilly to Crewe everyday to work and my return from Crewe back to Manchester the train time at 16:12 delays. Which makes me always miss my bus to my next job. Everyday Virgin is sorry or apologies for the delayed. This is disgusting. I wish I can rate is 0
235,Brilliant disaster preventing customer service,"I got onto the wrong train as I arrived at the platform at Preston station late... I got onto the train heading north to Glasgow instead of the one I needed to get onto going South towards London... I only realised when I saw that the train wasn't stopping and according to my train tracker I was meant to have already passed my stop at Wolverhampton... upon enquiry I learnt that I was indeed on the wrong train and when I consulted with the train manager I found out that the next stop was Glasgow and that would have been the last stop for the day... I didn't have enough money for anywhere to stay overnight or to get a train ticket in the morning from Glasgow... however I was delighted to find out that the extremely helpful lady, the train manager, had pulled a few strings, made a few calls and arranged for train to stop at an earlier station AND for a train going the other way to make an impromptu stop at the station for me the switch trains and provided me with a FREE customer service ticket as the means for my transport the following morning... although the train wasn't going all the way to my destination due to the time of day, the train stopped at Preston where the members on the platform reassured me for my transport the next day which was faultless as well... was my first time I used the service last November and I will always appreciate the great act of kindness by the Virgin trains workers... Thank you"
236,Constantly late,"Constantly late, never provided with full explanations or apologies. Made to run between trains and platforms, to stand stacked up like cattle. Awful."
237,Very disappointed with Virgin trains after sales approach,"Always book with Virgin trains direct via their website, in the past all has been good with no real problems, stuck on a train for 4 hours once due to power failure but hey things happen."
238,Got the 9.38am to Edinburgh from Wigan,"Got the 9.38am to Edinburgh from Wigan. Our first time in 1st class. Table hadn't been cleared, the attendant said we couldn't have a full breakfast as expected just a bacon roll or a fruit salad.  No plate and a sticky bread roll. Very disappointed."
239,outstanding refund,On 10th May I received a refund from Virgin for a trip to Preston from Edinburgh on 22nd April which had arrived over 2 hours late.Unfortunately there were 5 of us on the trip but the refund was only for 1 ticket.I immediately went on live chat as requested but they said they couldn't deal with that and I should email in.I also tried phoning but it just kept ringing.Since then I have emailed twice but only get automated responses and then nothing.The letter I received is very pleased with itself for dealing with my complaint so promptly .If only it was dealt with as I am due to refund money to the others and can't get it finished with.If there was a decent alternative I would never use this lot again as trains I get are invariably late.
240,Don't send them an email as they don't…,"Don't send them an email as they don't reply, not even after 28 days as promised. There is no after sales help if you are hard of hearing. Take your money elsewhere."
241,Virgin trains all stink,Virgin trains all stink of sewage.
242,I wanted to catch the Glasgow train to…,I wanted to catch the Glasgow train to Leeds as I was due on a course on Elland Road. I expected it to be busy obviously and it was indeed horrendous when I got there. Nobody would move so the women behind shouted up for them to move down they did and she got on. Next thing I know a virgin train staff member (male) comes up behind me and in the most patronising and nasty tone says “THE DOORS CLOSING” I looked around and said “Yes but I can’t get on..” he then leaned in (further adding insult that I was a child) (I’m 27 by the way) and said “ITS STILL CLOSING” he walked off blew the whistle and the automatic doors slammed in my face 😡 this is the 4th scenario I’ve had with them that’s been horrid.
243,booked 1st class Darlington to…,booked 1st class Darlington to Edinburgh plus journey care for 9.6.2018 No lunch served only 1 coffee and biscuits. Train run 30mins late. no representative from virgin at Edinburgh to assist under journey care. A rep from another company kindly undertook the task of getting me to the correct platform where I was met by one of my family
244,Brutal monopoly,"If they didn't have a monopoly on the east/west coast lines I'd avoid virgin trains completely. The customer service at Euston station have clearly been trained to not give any flexibility, I've watched them stand by whilst a passenger cried in front of them, weekend plans ruined."
245,I recently had the worst journey of my…shocking experience,"I recently had the worst journey of my life ,I was travelling from London Euston to glasgow ,on a virgin train ,"
246,I am shocked by how incredibly bad the staff is,Worst experience I ever had on a train journey.
247,Train journey in March 2018 was delayed…getting a refund from virgin is nigh on impossible,"Train journey in March 2018 was delayed for 60 minutes. Still trying to obtain a refund under their much heralded refund scheme. I bought three tickets, for myself and two colleagues. So far Virgin have only refunded one. My follow-up emails are ignored. I am not impressed with this company. They front themselves as passenger focussed and fair company - that's just marketing trickery.  Deserve 1 star from me."
248,Three stars for promptness,"Three stars for promptness, but I think it's time to get a few new trains. The one I got from Wolverhampton to London recently was revolting. Dirty, old battered seats. Just felt uncomfortable to sit on."
249,180 for a ticket and stood for 7 hours,Paid 180 for a ticket across the country and didn't even have a seat. I had a formal suit on for an interview so did not want to sit on the floor like most so had to stand for approximately 7 hours.
250,Delay and rip off fares,A mid day trip on a Saturday from Manchester to Milton Keynes the train was busy to the point that people were standing. The walk on fares cost more than using a motor vehicle. I cannot think of anything positive to day. When I used the service in the 90s under British Rail the trains might have been older but people typically got a seat and the fares actually made sense.
251,I complaint about the delay and asked…,"I complaint about the delay and asked for repay. At first they put the blame on West Midlands trains, forwarded my complaint to them, and eventually it turned out it’s virgin train’s fault. They haven’t replied for a week."
252,Website wouldn't let me book trian …,"Website wouldn't let me book trian combination wanted, even though it was two singles. Phoned up the call centre (not sure which part of the world it's located in but deffo no where near the uk) -  call centre person keeps saying all i have to do is book it and would I like to be talked though the process..... really do i sound that thick? After pointing out it's not allowing me too, she then offers to book it. Only to tell me she can't book that type of ticket. Fed up and running out of time I just ask her to book me any ticket, she comes back with a cost of around £43 /  then says I can buy a ticket at the station for £34.....so off I trott to the station and find out the cheapest ticket is £49.30..... great service as ever [don't bother calling Virgin trians customer help, after lots of jumping through hoops all you get is a recorded message telling you they can't be bothered to speak to anyone today, before being offered the joys of a live chat online.... odds on with some cheap labour on the other side of the planet)] - judging by the Trustpilot reviews Virgin trains don't give a dam anyway"
253,Virgin trains - bad choice,"Virgin trains - 3 train cancellations in 1 week, only traveled 4 times in total - what a disaster of train services. The usual template response from them - take a next train..... which might be in 1 hour, but who cares? They don't! As if people do not have schedules and appointments to keep... pathetic excuses, what a circus. Used to be good, key word is 'used', avoid them like plague if you don't want to be stuck in a middle of nowhere with your train suddenly going back....terminated.... and no alternatives offered. After running around the station grabbing everyone in a uniform asking what to do you might get lucky with alternative service offer.... definitely avoid their overpriced and never-on-time-lucky-to-arrive-at-all-services. All 3 cancelled journeys were between Manchester and London, July 2017."
254,Poorly organised,Poorly organised . Rat race with no management or care .
255,Almost comical,"Almost comical. We upgraded to 1st Class from Euston, London to Liverpool Lime Street. Sunday 09/07/2017 On the 12:05."
256,I can't thank the Virgin trains  staff …,I can't thank the Virgin trains  staff enough at Liverpool Lime Street for going above and beyond with their customer service and helping us out when another company let us down.
257,Terrible service,"Terrible service. Poor staff attitude, greedy and overpriced. Awful."
258,Filthy loos,"Three of us traveled from Edinburgh to London on 30 June by the 1st class coach leaving 11:30 am. The train started two hours late due to some signal fault. The seats were really cramped behind the centre table. The worst were the washrooms which were triangular, very small and extremely dirty. It was a real challenge getting in and out, the place stank and the WC looked as if it had never been cleaned. I travel in trains in the US which is always a pleasurable and relaxing experience and I was expecting something like that but have vowed never to repeat this in the UK. Highly highly disappointed."
259,Here's a complaint letter I wrote to …,Here's a complaint letter I wrote to Virgin today:
260,Hot & Late,"No air conditioning working, late running. Crowded. What rubbish service!"
261,NEVER put your traveller names on a ticket with Virgin,"Having booked travel for 4 people for a business trip & opt to print tickets with the traveller's individual names on it, I had a change of circumstance that required one name to be changed a week before we were due to travel.  I called Virgin Trains on 0344 556 5650 only to be greeted with constant patronising and obtuse conduct that I would expect Virgin Trains to be way beyond in their quality of service.  As I was getting nowhere, I demanded to speak to a supervisor who was about 90% as difficult as the last rep.  As an exception, they agreed to refund the one ticket I needed to change and processed the purchase of a new, more expensive ticket for the same journey, just with a new name on the ticket.  For this pleasure, there was a £20 admin fee (which I managed to get waived) and a £20 hike in ticket price."
262,I was delayed on Friday 30th June by …,I was delayed on Friday 30th June by 2hrs due to a jumper on the bridge from London to Liverpool.
263,unbelievable inefficient customer support,unbelievable inefficient customer support. Bought a ticket to from London to Dublin Connolly.  When I've arrived to Dublin port I had to pay the transfer from Dublin port to Dublin Connolly. Virgin explanation was
264,No Booking Requests Granted and Seats Reserved When They Are Free!,"I booked a seat, for the June 21st, 10.30am Euston to Glasgow train, with my reservation for Warrington, being the first stop, almost two hours later, at 12.15. I was pleased to be able to choose 'Facing' and 'Quiet', as I suffer badly from motion sickness, when traveling backwards. Hence using Virgin's own site, not National Rail or Greater Anglia site. I was travelling from Norwich, and had requested the same, 'facing' seat for that part of the journey, too."
265,Terrible customer service with regards to delayed trains - choose another rail company,"Back in my student days in London, I used to frequently catch the Virgin trains to visit family up north. Though often over-sold and monstrously packed, it was otherwise a decent service and certainly one I was familiar with."
266,First Class all the way.....,I used the off peak first class Manchester to London and as usual everything was lovely including the staff at both the lounge and the train. £45 and they even feed you and give you a g&t. That's fair in anyone's book 😀.
267,LOVE VIRGIN TRAINS FIRST CLASS BUT THE FOOD ?????,"I travel regularly on Virgin Trains and always First Class. My daughter lives in Birmingham and my best friends live in Glasgow, so super fast service whichever way I'm going"
268,Virgin guard mis-activated e-ticket and cost me £172,"I used the Trainline mobile app and booked a return from Liverpool Lime St to Euston going out Monday, back Tuesday - for my colleague and I."
269,Rail and Sale purchase that was not fit for purchase,"We purchased rail and sail tickets (North Wales station to Dublin) through the Virgin trains web site. There were 4 options in the 24 hours. We picked a package that gave us a train ticket and ferry ticket.  We paid £5 extra for the option which was the train journey and ferry ticket that got us on the fast boat over to Ireland. Unfortunately the train was delayed by 12 minutes. The result was that we were unable to get on the fast ferry and had to wait 2 hours for the next boat, which as it was a slower ferry meant a delay of 4 hours.  There was a whole train of people affected.  Irish ferries told us that we should not have been sold the ticket.  Virgin has told us that the train operator Arriva is responsible not them. When I pointed out to Virgin that they had sold us something not fit for purpose - the train if on time only gets in 30 minutes before the departure of the fast ferry and the close of check in is 30 minutes before departure, so why were they selling the train journey, they stated that the check in closes 30 minutes before departure or on the arrival of the connecting train - when I said this did not happen, Virgin said they could not comment as it was another companies decision.  Virgin are still selling this package, no other train option is given for the fast ferry (ie an earlier train), I have advise them to put the warning on the booking page that if the train is delayed by 10 minutes they will not be able to get the boat, so at least people are warned and can decide whether they want to waste money on a boat they may not be able to get.  Virgin have completely washed their hands of this, taking no liability for selling the package on their web site. Appalling customer service."
270,Virgin staff at Birmingham international station,"I love virgin trains and they are my first choice when available to travel across country, however when having to travel from Birmingham international I dread it as the virgin staff there are like no other. They are rude abrupt and if asked a question or for advice they let you know that you are causing them"
271,Shocking customer service!,Shocking customer service!
272,Shocking complaint handling. Just use another company.,Don't bother trying to get a refund for late trains if you have an e-ticket. They want you to save them time and money by ticketless travel but they can't cope with their refund promises if that is all you have. Their process and systems are a joke. The way they treat complaints would not be acceptable in most other businesses but they seem to get away with it. I can't believe they have real people responding to the complaints if they are they are a waste of time. I would rather travel with any other provider or method of transport if at all possible.
273,Abysmal customer service,"I will do my best to avoid ever using Virgin Trains again!  I bought first class return tickets on the East Coast main line in April for a special break for my wife and me.  The journey to London was very pleasant actually, but on the way back to Scotland we were delayed by over 2 hours, missed the connecting train and were crammed into standing room only carriages.  It was a dreadful journey."
274,Just read the story of the 16 year old …,Just read the story of the 16 year old girl who just missed her booked train and had to rely on a complete stranger to help her get another ticket as Virgin trains refused to help. Big business takes no responsibility to help children. Appalling.
275,Shocking customer service,Shocking customer service. if you actually get through to them
276,Nilesh is a star,Nilesh  very helpful in helping us with quite a serious problem.
277,Amazing Train Manager!,"I can't speak highly enough of the train manager,Ms Kirsty Smart, on the delayed 20:35 Kings Cross to Leeds on Sunday August 6th (2017). My son and I were travelling on that train and we were both extremely impressed by how efficient and professional Ms Smart was in dealing with a situation caused through absolutely no fault of Virgin trains. The train was absolutely packed because the previous train to Leeds had been cancelled so many people were in danger of missing their last connecting train en route to Leeds. Ms Smart was in constant contact with all the passengers on her train,reassuring everyone that she would do everything in her power to get everyone home - which is exactly what she did! She got every single one of the passengers to exactly where they had to be! She was absolutely amazing ..so calm and proficient as she repeatedly walked up and down the train aisle dealing with connecting passengers on a one-to-one basis.I've been on delayed trains before,I remember the stress and comments from angry passengers, but on this particular train,no-one, as far as I could hear/see was complaining ..quite the contrary actually! Ms Smart somehow transmitted an unusual sense of serenity and was absolutely meticulous in her directions ..for example ""passengers leaving the train at station X should disembark at exit door X ..your connecting train is waiting for you on platform X We're arriving on platform X so all you have to do is X"" So hats off to Ms Kirsty Smart for her highly professional customer-care skills and hats off to Virgin trains for employing someone who can keep your flag flying even in adverse circumstances!"

279,Words can't even describe how …,Words can't even describe how incompetent this company is!!
280,5 stars for the train manager on the …,5 stars for the train manager on the 20.35 from Kings Cross to Leeds this evening. There was big disruption on the line today - which I don't think was Virgin's fault. The manager did a brilliant job of  sorting out connections for passengers and reassuring them. She was brilliant!
281,"Kind, lovely, understanding staff","Such a lovely company. Me and my boyfriend are both only 15 and went down to London on the train and my mum and family went down in cars (as I was a bridesmaid so went down earlier). Mix up with bags as my mum left earlier than we had do catch our train and forgot my purse with the tickets were still in her bag! After being messed around at London Euston station, after having both my mum and my brother speak to several members of staff they were basically willing to leave two 15 year olds at London station -on our own- until they could get to a station and fax the tickets over! Which may of been a while as they were on the motorway home already. Our train was due to set off in 5 minutes, we were so worried we weren't going to make it home we went down to the train and I spoke to a man who works for virgin trains, he was so lovely and understanding and he re assured me and my mum, who were both frantically panicking, that he would ensure we got on and got home safe and he would speak to the people on the train for us and just for her to meet us when we got off to show the tickets then😌 So happy this man was so kind and understanding after the half an hour of panic and arguing to try and get us home and not left there on our own. Lovely lovely staff. Couldn't be more thankful! Thanks to him we got home safe and on time and we knew we didn't have to worry anymore!"
282,Pathetic approach to customer service,"Pathetic. I buy a train ticket, tick the box to receive no email communication but still receive an email 10 days before my journey, offering to send me more emails about my journey. It is a train journey, something that human being have been doing for around 200 years. We know to turn up at the station at the right time and get on the train we want. But no. According to Virgin, we need guidance on how to get to the station, platforms plans, information about the 'experience' and about our destination. I have never seen anything so infantalising or pathetic in all my life."
283,Dreadful avoid where possible,Dreadful.
284,Overpriced for what you get,Nowhere near enough luggage racks. The over head space for small luggage is so tiny that you can't fit anything in it. The tickets are expensive as hell and you have to pay for wifi. It's cheaper and faster to fly. Just do that.
285,Abuse at Stafford Station when disabled parking,I've just moved to Stafford and drop my partner at Stafford station. There is little to no parking dripnoff pick up spaces and granted it's a busy station. There are about 6 stop dropboff points but they are more free parking points and one disabled bag which needs re painting.
286,Compared to other rail networks in the …,Compared to other rail networks in the UK Virgin is way ahead. Using Virgin nearly every week to travel down to London I'm regularly impressed by the customer service training of staff and efficiency of operations as well as the relative comfort of carriages compared to other networks. If you book ahead the cost can be fantastic value - even during peak hour.
287,Proffitteering,"On the 1900 from Kings X to Edinburgh yesterday, coach D had no air conditioning, and overheated quite badly. The train was full in standard class, so the train manager made an announcement that there were empty seats in first class, and anyone suffering from the heat  was welcome to move. They just had to buy a first class ticket!"
288,Good customer service,"I traveled on Tuesday with Virgin Trains from Glasgow Central to London Euston. A freight train broke down in front of us which added a huge delay to the journey. Virgin staff were extremely helpful and ensured we stretched our legs on the platform we were thankfully sat at during the issues, brought us complimentary snacks and also kept us updated with as much info as they could provide. Upon arrival in Euston I was very worried as all tubes had finished for the evening as it was almost 3am but once I left the train staff were on hand to guide all customers to free taxis. Although the delay was a massive hassle, which was clearly out of Virgins control, the staff made up for this as much as possible."
289,The most APPALING customer service experience! Will never use Virgin Trains again!,"Wow where do I begin, I've recently experienced probably one of the worst customer service experiences ever."
290,Trains are way too expensive,"Trains are way too expensive! Tickets from Birmingham to London are so expensive (around £200) that if I would have to go there for any reason would have to work nearly a month at my part time job so that I could earn enough of money for a one way ticket. Never seen more expensive train tickets in my life. Absolutely not worth it. Even plain tickets are cheaper, I would advise you to reconsider the train ticket price as it disturbs people from living and moving around freely."
291,Horrendous online then phone services.,Horrendous online then phone services.
292,Useless,Useless. Make it as inconvenient as possible to obtain a refund - almost as if they want to keep your money or something. Chat staff do not handle 'monetary transactions' which apparently means they can't assist. The contact centre do no understand basic English and were entirely unhelpful. Wording on the website is unclear. All around amateur operation.
293,One star for Vitgin trains,"One star for Vitgin trains, it's not even worth that! Cramped conditions, dirty toilets, no trolley service, unfriendly and unprofessional staff. Maybe Richard Branson should try traveling by one of his trains instead of a hot air ballon! Appalling service!"
294,Awful,"Awful! Me (17) and my dad (55) have been fined £101 for getting on an early train which is out of 'offpeak' times. Apparently a train at 5:10 instead of 5:00 makes all the difference. The woman is called Karen and her customer service is bloody awful. We were polite the interior time and she walked off repeatedly.  She needs a bloody lesson in customer service, and Richard Branson needs to learn a thing about ripping people off for getting a train 10 minutes past the original one on an 'off peak open return' makes all the difference! Joke of a company"
295,Two together card issues,"We bought a two together rail card for our travel from Carlisle to London. Unfortunately the card did not arrive in time and I was planning on showing the purchase details of the card with the expiration date, passenger names and reference number as proof that we had purchased a card it simply didn't arrive in time for our journey. The train manager was very rude and abrupt saying about the terms and conditions of the train tickets and we had to purchase complete new tickets, even though she acknowledged that the information on my account proved I had purchased a rail card.. The tickets were FAR more expensive than online prices meaning we will be paying over £400 pounds in total for our journey. This seems like taking advantage of passengers who have made honest mistakes. It does not seem like a system that is set up in the interests of the customer and entraps them into paying extortionatly   large sums of money, also the customer service was appalling. We were treated like criminals when me and my pregnant wife are paying customers. Really disappointed. Probably​ will be taking the car from now on. I understand you have a system but I feel there must be some leeway in the face of extenuating circumstances which doesn't involve robbing customers blind! I will be sharing this experience with friends and family advising them to avoid Virgin trains on the basis that it is an unfriendly and unfair service."
296,Pricing system is morally disgusting,Pricing system is morally disgusting; VT are great argument for renationalizing

298,Virgin wi fi on the train is very poor,Virgin wi fi on the train is very poor. I paid £5 for 24 hour access and honestly it has barely worked at all between Euston and Warrington...don't bother wasting your money on it but pick up 4 G when you can en route.

300,East Coast Easter Meltdown,Bought tickets early for return Easter trip to Inverness from Kings Cross. Website would not allow me to RESERVE seats and I was unaware that I could do so at a later date.
301,There's bad. Then there's Virgin West Coast,"There's bad. Then there's Virgin West Coast. I tried to change my seat on a booking with Advance First Class. What a joke. I have to cancel the booking, get a refund and start again. Or, if closer to the booking, probably lose it. Seriously? Go to an airline, even with a restricted ticket, or even with Virgin East Coast, and swap your seat. After all, you're not changing train time or date. Simply a seat? The most customer-unfriendly approach you can take. I will go by car before I endorse this approach again. The feedback was: ""you are amending, and that's a 'change' so you can't"". Sure, restrict ticket elements. I get that: date and time. But a seat? Get real. Its taking 'restricted' to another level."
302,Booking frustration.,"Well, today I got yet another email from Virgin trains, naming me as a valuable customer and giving me a 20% discount code.  Only problem is I can't sign in to book tickets.  My password is never accepted. I've tried changing it and even using a separate email account to set up another account. The site lets me sign in, then choose tickets, then, just as I want to go forward it asks me to sign in again.  You've guessed it, the password fails."
303,First time ever on a virgin train and the last,"First time ever on a virgin train and I will never use them again got thetrain from Preston to Lancaster on wed after a stressful hospital appointment took a seat and during the journey water poured through the luggage rack above me into my handbag and onto the seat, sent  a email to them on Thursday and the reply was they were sorry and the leak was because of the hot weather no mention of my ruined handbag and contents if I could give  minus I would  shocking customer service"
304,Out of there way for a gluten free lady,I wanted to write a review as I felt the Virgin train staff on the 12.57 from Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston virgin were bloody brilliant. I have been diagnosed with a gluten intolerance recently and find it difficult to find food on the go unless I buy it from a supermarket and make it myself. I was travelling first class and mentioned that I could not have there choice in sandwiches as I was gluten free. Ken told me not to worry he would make me a bacon buttie with gluten free rolls. I was thrilled! I also wanted to say a big thank you to Kev on the same service who was really friendly and nothing was to much trouble. They both made my journey great and made my day. Thanks guys :-)
305,We're Sorry,"All I will say is that if Virgin were as good at running a service as they are at saying sorry, I'd probably be a happy customer."
306,Outrageous monopoly from London to …,"Outrageous monopoly from London to Manchester, pretends to be a cool brand with stupid joke messages in train toilets, it is a tight business with no flexibility nor regard to its customers. Impossible to get a refund on missed train, very rude customer service at euston station."
307,Virgin Trains Partnership with Nectar,"I have utilised the Virgin East Coast line to commute to London from Leeds over the last two years, over that time there have only been minimal disruption. The booking of tickets through the Virgin Train App has always been easy and painless, Its a shame that their partnership with Nectar has soured the experience, I only recently discovered that the points for all those journeys haven't been allocated to my Nectar card and Nectar don't seem to care. If you book through the App and link your Nectar card make sure you get the points awarded!!!!"
308,"awful train, WORSE customer service.","I took a Virgin train to London in March, and I have never experienced such a bad journey before."
309,Asked at the virgin ticket office a …,Asked at the virgin ticket office a virgin return ticket from bham to London.
310,Virgin Trains Android plus Customer Service,"I used their Android app (for the first time) to buy my train ticket. The payment went through - it always does doesn't it - but the tickets could not be generated / downloaded. The message was 'Contact Customer Service'. As it was 1AM, I left it until the morning: surely they could resolve the website  glitch by then. In the morning, at the station - no tickets, same message. No phone number, no reference, 10 min before the train. Bought a regular ticket. Got to the Customer Service ~1 h later (you have to study the app to find contact numbers), explained what happened. No interest shown, was suggested to cancel the ticket for a standard  £10 fee (for  £15 ticket). Complained in writing. Was told off, twice. Still cannot understand what I have done wrong. Sure, a cozy monopoly on rail travel plus a third-world country customer service makes it a nice business model.  Small Claims Courts have worked pretty well for me in the past but should I bother for a tenner?"
311,"Virgin trains, great compensation experience...","I travelled on the West Coast line in April 2017. Both legs of the journey were uneventful - efficient, on time and hassle-free. However, on the way back my train was held at a station due to a power failure at Euston. I got home via other routes and was told I could claim compensation online. I did so - it was an easy, straight-forward process requiring me to scan/photo my tickets and upload them. Within a week I was pleasantly surprised to receive a full refund of my whole return ticket!! No hassle, no quibble, and a nice letter. TIP - keep your ticket(s), and if you don't have a scanner, just take a photo on your camera and email to yourself to upload."
312,Absolutely awful customer service,"Absolutely awful customer service, I have been trying to get a refund for a ticket but they are the most unhelpful company ever. You cannot speak to them over the phone only via a compliant form that they do not reply too! I have been robbed £169 as I had to buy twice due to their awful staff"
313,The woman guard on the train back from …,The woman guard on the train back from Preston yesterday is seriously in the wrong job. She shouted at my 14 year old daughter had her in tears after she explained I had the tickets and was scared to travel alone. I had one foot on the train and she tried to block me getting on it telking me tough. Her customer service skills are appalling my daughter's still upset and never wants to travel on Virgin trains again
314,Absolutely Despicable,"Absolutely Despicable. I booked tickets in advance as I like to be organised. However, my boyfriend is in the forces and has been deployed away for 4 months quite suddenly. We booked the train for our last week together before he left and obviously were devastated when we couldnt go. I asked the trainline if they could refund it and they said yes but at a charge of £40. However, my mother and I would be travelling to the same destination in two months time. They refused to swap the tickets over and charged more for the same journey in august PLUS the £40. Both virgin and the trainline agreed to this and wouldnt refund us. They wouldnt even take money off our next journey. They spoke to us like dirt and GREEDILY took our money. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. My boyfriend is off defending our country and these greedy companies dont care and have no empathy. I am also a student so £40 is a big deal to me. Cannot believe the service I received - they should BOTH be ashamed."
315,"Usually bad, but even worse this time.","Virgin East Coast are well known for being useless. I have taken to travelling and couple of hours before any major meetings as I have been delayed so many times. But this week was even worse. I was told my ticket was invalid on the London to York service I was on - even though I had been told otherwise - and the 'revenue protection officer' tried to make me pay an extra £129. After the unhelpful guard had told me which train my ticket was valid on (including that same train after Peterborough - but I couldn't stay on it as I hadn't joined it there?!) I was told by the guard on the next train that my ticket wasn't valid on that service either! Anyway, I eventually got home much later than planned, and it had to involve a £30 taxi ride home as I missed the last train. Awful treatment by Virgin. I had been representing the UK in Brussels and chose to get the train. Next time I'll fly."
316,I was born on the Wirral and have been …,"I was born on the Wirral and have been living in London for the past 8 years. therefore I have been using virgin trains to see my family for 8 years. I have put up with the rising train fares, crowded carriages and broken toilets. Recently I have had a death in the family and had to arrange a trip back home. In my emotional state I accidentally through away my return ticket thinking it was the receipt. I spoke with there helpline and ticket office and train conductors and was so told there was nothing they can do and I had to purchase a new ticket costing me £85.50. I think it is disgusting that in 8 years of travel with virgin train they weren't able to help me in my hour of need. I would have even beared a coat of a reprint, but apparently there was nothing they could do. I will not be travelling with virgin trains again. Worst Customer service I have every received I my 29 years."
317,Online booking not fit for purpose,"absolutely useless. Virgin's online booking gave me a series of m-tickets when I asked for real tickets because they need to be distributed among a bunch of elderly people who do not use mobile phones. Moreover, the travellers are coming from different parts of the country. When calling their helpline to get the useless m-tickets swapped the ONLY swap-option they could offer was to CANCEL the entire booking and rebook ensuring 'self-print' was selected. In this case the number of seats booked and the closeness to the time of departure meant that there was absolutely no guarantee that the tickets would still be available at all (let alone the same price). Virgin's system is clearly at the 'alpha' stage of development and not even ready for 'beta' release."
318,I travelled from Wigan to Wolverhampton …,I travelled from Wigan to Wolverhampton and ended up paying 85 quid.....
319,Stealing every penny from customers,One of the worst customer services I have ever encountered. I had purchased 2 tickets for July 16th instead of 17th. Changed them paying the fare difference plus 10 GBP per passenger. The balance refund was due after I send the old tickets via recorded delivery.
320,Always choose VT over LM,"I get the train every day for work, and can choose between the Virgin service and the London midland service. The Virgin always has seats, is fast, comfortable, and generally is on time. The onboard shop is expensive but you expect that. Compare that with the London Midland, which is always overcrowded, hot, and a generally unpleasant experience. I choose the Virgin train whenever I can."
321,Visit to Edinburgh…,"Thank you for an extremely interesting and pleasant journey to and from Edinburgh. The external on both sets was clean with the same for the internal. The catering and food was excellent and the staff were a credit to Virgin. ""On time"" departures and arrivals were nothing more than we expected."
322,Can we just jump in & defend the …,Can we just jump in & defend the wonderful staff we had on our virgin train journey to London on Thursday 8th June (at 8.40am). My husband took ill on the train and they were amazing! They managed to keep our daughter calm and stopped the train at the nearest train station where they organised an ambulance to take him to hospital.
323,Need to find alternative,"smelly chairs, chewing gum under tables, rude staff , problems on every service ,stinking toilets , and all they ever do is promote their in service shop. I use the service every week because I have to even though it is not a good service apart from the train stays on the tracks."
324,The worst!,Actually the worst train service I've used. Worse than Southern Trains so that is saying something.
325,Lack of Flexibility and Support,"Unfortunately, I had a negative experience with Virgin Trains. I had already purchased a very expense round-trip ticket, and after I had used my departure ticket to get on my first train, I dropped it and couldn’t find it. I still had my return ticket and receipt for the trip, however Virgin would not print me a new ticket to use to complete my journey. I also could not use the ticket on my mobile device. Instead, I was forced to buy a new single way ticket for 82 pounds. This being my first time in England using the train, I felt very taken advantage of. I thought the service of the train was great, but unfortunately I do not think I would use it for my future travels because of the lack of understanding and flexibility on the part of the train line."
326,Complete Joke,Virgin basically let us cook on a train for a 4 hour journey with no air conditioning. The staff told us on that if we put in a complaint online and kept the tickets there would be some form of compensation - it has been 6 months and still no reply from them. I have tried email and social media however they just give me the run around and ignore me another big company which does not care about its customers would whenever possible not book with them.
327,Does virgin have morals?,On the 4:30 train to Edinburgh to London Kings Cross in coach E. Was looking forward to a peaceful journey when all passengers were interrupted by the conductor arguing unfairly with two tourists who had gotten on the wrong train. The outcome was he refunded one friend and the other friend had to pay. They had gotten a train 20 minutes earlier by accident as they never realised that there were two different trains. They were treated so unfairly and this should not happen to anyone. My mum and I had gotten a train before hand and were told we could catch any train at any time as long as we had the tickets yet they were told differently and completely humiliated.
328,"Packed train, no wifi as stated, no customer service","Included with ticket price Wifi did not work, no one on train can help, 10 min wait for IT helpline & every time get cut off as one is on a train.  Gave up after 5 calls."
329,Very pleasant trip to London (First Class),"Excellent food and very good service in first class. Free Wifi, which allowed streaming of a range of films and TV programmes when using their App (not YouTube though)."
330,Best train Manager Hands Down,"Back in the summer, I and 3 others had bought tickets to travel to Edinburgh on a very early morning train- we were to meet at Coventry station,but the taxi company I had booked disappointed me- to cut the story short I missed my train- I wanted to die a slow death and the virgin train staff advised that it was up to the discretion of the train manager on the next train to decide if he would agree to take me on..he did- that's when I really should have written this review but I did not."
331,Useless Customer Service,"Ive been trying to sort out a complaint since the 14th December 2016. Ive spent hours talking with advisors online and on the telephone, unfortunately despite asking to speak to someone whom works in England im always put through to someone who is India and hasnt the authority to do anything!"
332,Poor quality.,"Broken armrest...cold tea.....menu poor, what was.left of it!"
333,Atrocious Customer Service and advice.  Will not book with Virgin Trains again!,"We needed to change our Outward journey due to Sky dictating kick-off times.  Called Virgin Trains who told me to book new tickets and post back old ones for refund to credit card, less £10 for each ticket returned. Slavishly obeyed with tickets sent with proof of postage. After approx. 4 weeks still no refund to credit card. Called Virgin Trains who accepted they had had tickets back but they were non-refundable!! I complained that I had been given wrong advice previously but told a manager would call me within 24 to 48 hours after listening to recording of initial call.  No call from manager after 3 to 4 days so called back. This time told the following: they would need to check tickets had been returned that call-backs from a manager would be within next 4 hours and that I there was every possibility that credit would be within next 2 to 3 days.  Guess what - I'm going to make yet another call to Virgin Trains and speak to someone in their atrocious Customer services department. Like a previous reviewer I'd like to leave a NO STAR rating."
334,My first long distance journey,Not just my first long distance journey but my first time in First Class.
335,train journey,my return journey 27/12/2016 newcastle to london  12:29
336,fast but expensive,bieng a uni student i love the service of vigin trains because its very fast and gets to birmingham from london within 1 an a half hours but then sometimes it costs around £100 per trip where as the national express  £20 is the maximum return tickets sometimes even in last minutes so if the target is to save time go for virgin trains but if you have an extra hour i would say go for national express.
337,"If I was CEO, I would've fired this staff on the spot.","I was in the first car, which was fairly empty. Between Penrith and Carlisle, it sounded like a hen party for all the attendants sitting in the back, talking and laughing.  Honestly, embarrassing for them, I had to ask for hot tea. How hard would it have been to check with me and the only other person in the car if they needed anything?  They have it much too easy, apparently."
338,Rip-off,"Sadistically overpriced. Overcrowded trains: unsafe number of people in carriages (was once given a ticket with no seat reservation from London to Edinburgh, with people crammed into the carriages and left to stand). Uncomfortable seats with no leg room once you do get one. Patronising marketing and design (writing under mirror: 'Go on, give us a smile!'. Not worth the ridiculous price."
339,"Travel 50 weeks a year and after trying Virgin Trains I will never go near anything Virgin,",Travel 50 weeks a year and never complain but after trying Virgin Trains I will never go near anything Virgin again.
340,customer service phone line is a joke,"I received vouchers in lieu of being delayed for 4 hours on a stationary train.  You have to call Virgin to redeem them and then you have to send the voucher by special delivery to their Edinburgh office and they post you the tickets.  I had all of my details pre-prepared and rang to book 4 journeys.  Their call centre is in India so it wasn't clear that the staff had fully understood what I'd booked so I checked the booking and one return journey had been made for the wrong month.  I rang them back and they advised me that I had to wait 72 hours before they could check the phone call recording and make sure the error was theirs and not mine.  As one of the booked journeys was only 2 weeks away I sent the voucher to Edinburgh with a letter clearly explaining that one of the bookings attached to the reference number was incorrect.  Three days later I received all of the tickets including those for the incorrect train journey.  Did no-one bother to read the letter?  I have had to ring the call centre a third time and ask why no-one has got back to me about the incorrect  booking.  They checked the booking and said there was a note to say it was their error and they agreed to re-book it for the correct dates.  I had to pay for the new booking and send the wrong tickets back to Edinburgh and await a refund.  So, they compensate me for a delayed train and then I have to spend hours on the phone and writing letters and pay £6 for special delivery twice and pay up front for a ticket that should be complimentary and then wait for a refund."
341,Liverpool lime st closed,"I am not one for entering reviews. But using Runcorn stn today due the landslide at Liverpool lime st.  Virgin had made the effort  to look after its customers, with plenty of boots on the ground.  The staff were  helpful and friendly.  Well done virgin."
342,Great journey,The train was very impressive just looking st the outside. I was sat in first class and it felt as if I was in a plane. The train was very long and looked after. Was treated to free food and drink of which we're both very nice. The train was quiet and very fast. An overall perfect experience you want when traveling the country. I'll be using this way of travelling from now on.
343,"Manic, but a one-off","People from 3 different-timed trains directed to only one, coach D (my reservation) was apparently non-existent and we were eventually told to go to coach C, wherein the reserved seats were already completely blocked up by people on coach C, who were then told to go to coach F? Terrible planning in the Ace of cancellations, but I've been on Virgin Trains before and it's been completely smooth and an easy journey. Don't think I will be travelling with them again, though, in case something like this happens again"
344,More Than Adequately Compensated,I had my railcard withheld by an incompetent manager at the Edinburgh Travel Centre in October of last year on the premise that it had been altered-which it had not.
345,Con-artists,"I bought a ticket for a virgin train which I subsequently missed by one minute (despite running) as there were works going on at one of the underground stations which delayed my journey. When I went to the ticket office to explain they told me there was nothing they could do other than pay for a new ticket and get a different service. They would not refund my ticket and said I would have to get in touch with southeastern about a possible refund. It is unbelievable that you can pay £65 for a ticket and then have such an appallingly bad service. If I could give no stars I would. Rude, incompetent and money-grabbing!!"
346,Rude male staff,I am very hard of hearing and didn't catch the description of what was on offer to eat. When the man came round I asked him to repeat it he said it was repeated twice and wouldn't let me know what was on offer he was very rude. I will not travel virgin again if this is the way passengers are treated especially with a disability.
347,Non-existent customer complaints response,"Travelled London Euston-Coventry on 5/12/16. Bought Ist Class ticket. Lack of staff, meant that there was no at seat refreshment service. Only provision was a 'free' hot drink from the on-board shop. Told that we had to buy the sandwiches that we had already paid for!"
348,Jokers,"Only use as i have no choice. Very poor service when you need to arrange a complaint / refund. Automated message saying aim to reply in 10 days, then another saying 20 days. When the finally reply its a template email. They reply with a reaponce that makes no sense to my complaint, so i reply to it, wait another 20 days and they reply with the same template email. Jokers."
349,We got the train from Newcastle to …,"We got the train from Newcastle to Edinburgh 31st jan 17 , the captain (who keeps people updated, not sure what you call him) was absolutely brilliant, really kind friendly and helpful He done an amazing job, made the journey extra perfect"
350,POOR! POOR! POOR!,"Unbelievable, not impressive and expensive. So I travelled with my family via Virgin from London to Birmingham. It cost more than the other carrier and so we expected a higher standard. We paid for a table and 4 seats with window view for our family for this long journey. Instead when we got on the train we had front facing seats, a blank wal that shielded our view,   no table  and NO STAFF TO ASSIST. We then observed people sitting anywhere they pleased despite the reserved seat signs. I am dusgusted! Needless to say I will not be travelling with Virgin again. Hopefully Richard Branson would get iff his island and tend to his business.POOR! POOR! POOR!"
351,Unbelievably shocking experience on the …,Unbelievably shocking experience on the 23rd Dec 2017.
352,Avoid Virgin Trains!,"£100 seat reservation only to end up sitting on the floor next to the toilet, as the train was jam packed. Customer service advisors are rude and unhelpful"
353,100% fare increase,"My weekly commute from Brighton to Wilmslow has just increased by 100%.  I emailed and was given a generic response.  I challenged again and VT confirmed that yes, the advance fares offered on my specific train have increased by 100%.  As they are Advance tickets it appears they are unregulated and VT can increase them at will.  Truly appalling and a major impact on the quality of my work life balance as I now need to make alternative arrangements to commute between home and work."
354,Late and filthy,"Late, filthy, need I say more! I'm surprised this company keeps going!"
355,Offered 20% discount on travel but charged full price with no discount,Virgin kindly Sent me email with 20% discount off my next travel.  Upon booking and paying for my ticket via link from Virgin.  i discovered no discount has been applied and ended paying full price. 4 calla later and no one wants to dear with issue or explain why. Having a horrible experiance. Very unfriendly and unhelpful staff.  Only would like to know why they wont give me what they offered me.
356,An absolute rip off and they have the …,An absolute rip off and they have the monopoly on certain routes like London to Manchester.
357,No problems with service on trains,No problems with service on trains. (Can’t do anything about delays as generally it’s nit their fault)
358,Monopoly = Maximised PROFITS,Monopoly Definition:
359,Seats not marked as reserved,"I got a liverpool train on 18/01/18 and reserved the seats, but in train seat numbers are not marked as reserved, because of this we had to unnecessarily argue with other passengers who sit over our seats"
360,Unfortunately I have no choice to use …,Unfortunately I have no choice to use as no option. Appalling service late trains and no information or if there is information it is wrong. Avoid
361,Hello,Hello
362,Clever way to con their customers!,"Wow, terrible customer service, staff who give completely conflicting information and a very clever way to fleece their customers.  Avoid at all cost and look forward to them losing the franchise for the rail route in due course."
363,I have just dealt with a delay claim …,I have just dealt with a delay claim which had problems on the timing on the claim with Virgin East Coast Trains Customer Services. I see a lot of negative reviews on this site but all I can say is my experience has been to the opposite. They have always been straight forward to deal with and the problem was sorted out
364,If I could get minus on the star guide …,"If I could get minus on the star guide I'd attribute that ! VIRGIN STAFF ARE DOWNRIGHT RUDE, not all but the worst are definitely on  Glasgow to London and vice versa. The Virgin Gestapo."
365,Shocking Vigin train experience,"Do you read all the reviews? This company has one of the worst ratings of all! I travelled for the first time today and before your pathetic defence of it being a bank holiday - I wish I had gone back to Heathrow even after the fiasco of yesterday's cancellations. It was literally a stampede at Kings X when the platform was announced only to find that EVERY seat was reserved, creating havoc as people crammed the train but could not sit down as only a handful of passengers had actually reserved seats. Why we're all the seats showing a reservation if they weren't?"
366,*** you and your pay-as-you-go Wi-Fi,"*** you and your pay-as-you-go Wi-Fi. Buses are providing free Wi-Fi, airports are providing free Wi-Fi, skiffs in the Mediterranean are providing free Wi-Fi. Penetrate me with your high ticket prices, but at least offer the same services as every other developed transport company, you backwards bunch of *****."
367,Disgusted!,Bought first class return ticket and part did not print. Office closed and no one was able to help! Refused to reprint part that was missing although I had email confirmation and reservation portion! Had to buy another ticket just to get home! Disgusting! Poor poor poor!
368,Mixed views,"Train journeys are efficient, punctual and the carriages are good."
369,Useles,Just like all virgin companies virgin trains are a rip off and give terrible service. 0nce again my train from London to Birmingham new street (supposedly the flagship line) was cancelled. Once again the following train was delayed. Once again the train operator didn't bother announcing how late they are and when they are likely to reach new st. The train is currently 25 minutes after when it was supposed to be getting in and dawdling along at walking pace so no idea when it will get in. So I will be getting on for an hour late again and will have missed a number of ongoing connections. Do virgin care? I don't believe so as the one time I could be bothered to ask for a refund for a £176 ticket for a train which never went anywhere I have heard nothing 2 months later. I might as well get the slow trains for a fraction of the price rather than the 170 odd quid per day ticket or the £1000 plus season ticket I currently have. Not happy at all
370,Amateur operation,Boarded at Grantham heading for London on a first class ticket - shortly after boarding they announced that they had 'run out of food' - bags of crisps offered instead.
371,Hit and miss,"I never had any serious problems with Virgin Trains - on a good day travelling with them is very pleasant, on a worse one I feel like I paid way too much for a service that didn't meet my expectations."
372,I just love sitting on the floor by the toilets!,"Due to there being far too many passengers booked onto and far too few seats on our train, we spent the whole journey sitting on the floor next to the toilets in the area between carriages along with ten other fare paying passengers and their luggage. The aisles were also full of standing, fare payers thus making seated passengers comfort and experience of the fabulous Virgin Service severely compromised. At times I thought I was back in the 80's inter railing in rural Greece but then I realised it was more like a Michael Palin trip through deepest India, I was staggered that there were not people clinging to the outside of the carriages. What a truly horrible experience this was, Virgin should be ashamed of their operation. They promise a service they don't deliver. It is totally unacceptable to treat people like cattle in 2016. Absolutely rubbish Richard."
373,Upsetting experience by catering staff,"I travelled back from Leeds to London Kings Cross, from a work trip, on the 15:15 train from Leeds to London, Kings Cross.  After settling into a seat in Carriage D I decided that I would buy some refreshment for my journey.  After a while a FULLY STOCKED catering trolley came through the carriage.  It served some people in seats two rows ahead of me, then the lady (Rebecca – I think it was) quickly whizzed past me and served a gentleman behind me.  I asked TWICE if I could be served but the lady refused, just telling me “I’ll be back”."
374,"Awful service, persistent problem","I have to travel to London at least twice a year for family or work related purposes and usually go through Preston. Nearly always there seems to b a problem at Preston that delays the journey by hours - usually something that was known about in advance. Trains cancelled without notice, trains unable to go further without a train supervisor or a driver. I now fly to London rather than take train. I have just gotten off the phone to my sister who is stranded on a train that is sitting at Preston (on her way to Liverpool) and will not be going further. They are waiting for a staff member to appear to inform them what to do next. She has a course at 9am tomorrow. The likelihood is she will have to take a taxi from where she is and have to fight for reimbursement. At times like this Virgin staff are useless, rude, and evasive if they do appear however are mostly non-existent. Virgintrains...you are terrible. It infuriates me that you are often the only choice of rail service to go south."
375,"Shocking lack of any customer care, totally ignore e mails.","Recently I was delayed on a train journey, arriving over one hour late. This caused me to miss a birthday dinner, because of the delay. As you are able to claim a re-fund I contacted them by e mail on 5th November, they replied on 7th November saying they had forwarded my e mail to Customer care. As I heard nothing, I e mailed again on 18th November, and again on 24th November.  They just do not bother to reply."
376,Train Service,Train delayed resulting in me missing my connection complained to Virgin Trains my complaint was ignored have now sent 6 E Mails still no reply this companies service is a disgrace.
377,I just paid £11 for a Stockport to Manchester return...,"I'm not a frequent train user, but today I needed to go to town so I bought a return out of the machine, one ticket came out stating 'return' on it. Since I get the train about once every 5 years I thought this was normal.  On the way back home I wasn't allowed out of the station as the guy said I should have 2 tickets, even though only one came out of the machine. He called me a liar and said my mate probably gave me ""half his ticket""  even though I was alone! (what??) Are these people for real? So I was forced into buying a new £4.00 ticket just to leave. Guy at counter was rude too. Next time I'm just gonna jump over the barrier, mugs."
378,"If I could rate 0 stars, I would","I am appalled with Virgin Trains and the way my colleague and I have just been treated by their employees. We are in London on a business trip and purchased our tickets in advance. When we got to the station in Manchester, we asked one of the Virgin Trains employees to look at our e-ticket and tell us where to go and they pointed to one of the trains and told us to go there. We got on the train and were approached by one of their employees who asked for our tickets and ended up charging us (again!) 85 GBP because we accidentally got on a train that was 10 minutes earlier (even though we were directed to it by other Virgin Trains employees!). On top of it all, the employee was extremely rude and when we tried to explain the situation which caused our confusion, he threatened us that he'd involve the police. The whole trip ended up costing us over 200 GBP and we are absolutely shocked.."
379,No refunds on E-tickets BEWARE,If you buy a ticket and choose to get an e-ticket you are no longer able to change the time/date of your train or get a refund. Even if you pay the admin fee. They hide this in their T&Cs. This wouldn't be acceptable in any other industry so don't know how they get away with this.
380,🚄 Good service,I travel from Preston to London Euston and Preston to Edinburgh using the Virgin Pendilino service at least 4 times a year and have done so for the last 5-6 years.
381,Unpleasant journey,"We went to Newcastle from Kirkcaldy on 9th December 2016 and the train was absolutely freezing. The trip back wasn't quite so bad to start with, nice quite carriage we were playing music on our phone quietly with no additional speakers the conductor passed us and said turn that music off no eye contact he just continued walking and said it's not allowed on virgin train in any carraiges. VERY RUDE STAFF. We weren't  being noisy or rowdy and couldn't see anything saying we were not allowed to play music. We certainly were not disturbing anyone. We did ask the other 2 people near us and they said there wasn't a problem conductors attitude was shocking."
382,True booking confusion and a miserable bunch of employees,"First experience with travelling and cannot believe the ridiculously poor booking system.  It's clear that some trains are faster and thus more expensive but it's very unclear that the slow one is the equivalent of riding the tube. After a incorrectly booked ticket and having to get another at the correct time (no sympathy, money lost) - I then paid £65 for first class but there wasn't anything that justified the price. Also it seems common place for everybody to just pile on regardless if they hold a first class ticket or not. The pricing on the page is not clear- they list standard tickets as off peak and off peak is put under trains that are not off peak. Did I mention it's impossible to tell what direction the train is travelling. I thought on the way home with my booked FC ticket on the fast service things would be better. I arrive, see my platform do go down and get on the train. I happen to look out and see it is a train leaving 20 minutes earlier. Figured it would be fine being not a single person is in the train car. Nope - the miserable guy setting things up might as well said get the hell off. I had an advanced ticket which he referred to as not full price. It is full price just not flexible. As the train is about to pull off I ask the manger who scathed at me with a too bad so sad attitude. Absolutely appalling customer ""service"". Avoid at all cost. Richard Branson should be ashamed putting his name in this business."
383,Inhumane way of transporting people,"Virgin trains are the pits, the worst most crowded inhumane way of transporting people, if you transported cattle in the same disgusting cramped conditions you would go to prison. My last journey was so bad that I had to get off the train and get a taxi back home, cancelling my journey, there were 27 of us crammed in the space between 2 carriages and the air was so thick and stale people were struggling to breathe. I will never travel by train again, i feel sorry for those who have no option. Disgusting service :("
384,Great customer service,"Big thank you to Mandy at Euston...courteous, polite and helpful...didn't have to be, just went that step further to help. Thank you"
385,DISABLED-UNFRIENDLY TRAVEL AND HATE-SPEECH USING STAFF,"Virgin Trains disgust me; specifically, the typical default behavior of the staff the employ at all levels disgusts me."
386,2 Hour+ Journey not heating,1st time I have ever been on a virgin train Kings Cross to Leeds. No heating on the train. I was freezing! I had to use my gloves as my hands were stinging. When we reached Leeds we were shivering with the cold. What a rubbish Service.
387,ruined our treat,"I fell for the advertising on the east coast line and took my son for an overnight stay in Durham.Booked 1st Class so we could have the, highly advertised, evening meal which was why we went 1st class. It worked well on the outward journey and we had a nice evening meal."
388,First Class was much better before Virgin,"First class used to be nice!! Nice hot meals have been replaced by ""a gourmet sausage roll with gourmet chutney""!! If you've just paid out for a first class ticket do you really want a sausage roll?!? There used to be nice cakes when it was East Coast! They've disappeared!! The nice sandwiches have been replaced by dodgy bacon sarnies and a houmous wrap where the houmous layer was so thin that they seem to have made a scientific breakthrough by splitting the houmous atom!! Used to get a cup of tea - now that gets offered to me 10 seconds before we roll into Peterborough and I don't ever really feel like a tea shot ""down in one""!!"
389,Trains were fine (even when disrupted) but NO customer service,"Before I start, I have been on trains before to London and they were fine. Yes, now and again something can go wrong but there is a level of acceptance from both ends, which can be rectified and sorted out either there and then, or by the customer service later. But being denied entry to a train that I have booked and have a reservation, then being told to get the next one in an hour, with no seat reservation, and wait an extra 30mins for the driver to turn up.... all the while wondering whether or not I was going to be stuck at my transfer destination of York because no more trains were running.... NOT acceptable. How about you honor your agreement and allow your customers to get on the train that they paid for, and sit in the seat that is reserved for them! I didn't make it to the destination I paid for, so had to pay £20 extra for a taxi on top of the disruption that was caused to my journey . Even still, when I sent a message to Virgin trains, I got a reply saying its not their problem pretty much, rather it was a different part of Virgin trains that is responsible and they will forward the message. I waited 2 months for a reply....NOTHING. Then sent another message, with an automated response saying I will hear from them in 10 days. It has been 40 days! What a joke!"
390,Third class service in first class,Busted seat no reservations and limited catering   Did get a tea that was clearly made in Newcastle I got on at Newark.  Just don't waste your money
391,Very poor customer service,I am very disappointed with Virgin trains customer service. Because my friend who is a registered blind person had his ticket stolen while on a visit to London he had to buy a replacement ticket from Virgin ticket staff at Euston they told us we would be able to reclaim the cost of £39.50 by supplying a crime number to Customer services. However Virgin customer services have decided to ignore that promise. I have also involved London travel watch who have apealed to Virgin on my behalf without success. London Travel watch have told me that they are very disappointed with Virgin trains attitude over this matter.
392,Grubby small minded company,Why do companies like Virgin think its fine to overcharge their customers?
393,WiFi on Virgin Trains is a joke,WiFi on Virgin Trains is an absolute joke.  I pay over £130 to travel to London and they expect me to pay for WiFi.  This is free on Arriva and Transpennine Trains.
394,Rubbish,"Myself, my husband and 11 year old son travelled from Manchester to London in December and I paid for first class tickets. The breakfast was awful and no snack box was offered on the way there. I am assuming that this was because part way through the journey they declassified first class. On the tannoy we were told to contact virgin who would compensate. I assumed this would be the difference between price for standard and first class. On our return journey, we tried to disembark the train at Manchester only to be pinned against the seats by Manchester Utd fans on their way home, who bombarded the train. They had no allocated seats which meant it was a free for all. My son was on crutches and couldn't move. The response from virgin 6 weeks later was a cheque for £15 compensation and an email to say if I wasn't happy with the conduct of the football fans,  to contact transport police and it's not their fault if people don't listen to instructions to let people leave the train before getting on. I've been told the compensation is sufficient. Rubbish customer service."
395,I travelled to London from Manchester …,"I travelled to London from Manchester and the service was exceptional, the staff Carole , Steve and Gail couldn't do enough for us ."
396,Censorship,"Virgin Trains’ decision to stop selling the Daily Mail is nothing short of censorship. What gives them the right to impose their prejudiced views on their customers? Well, my response will in future be to avoid using Virgin trains."
397,Excellent staff on board and would …,Excellent staff on board and would recommend 1st class from Edinburgh to Newcastle. App and wifi worked well.
398,Only their monopoly keeps them in business,From the top:
399,Just amazingly crap,Well I actually thought I was going to be in the minority giving this rating but it's refreshing to see that I'm not.
400,Started using them a few times a month,"Started using them a few times a month, but while their marketing is sleek their support service is very random and good luck trying to get them to reply when dealing with ticket refunds. You get passed around and once you reach (possibly) the right team they are super slow...."
401,First class vastly improved,What a difference a year makes. We travelled first class from Edinburgh to London's King Cross almost exactly a year ago and the service and food were very poor quality. Fast forward a year and it has vastly improved. A new James Martin menu has been introduced and it is so tasty. I got chicken curry on the way down and vegetable tagine on the way back. Both were lovely if a tad small - the muffin was moist and tasty - although on the way back they didn't have the advertised desert. The service was prompt and friendly and not stingy with the booze! Our journey was during the week so no idea if it is the same standard at the weekend.
402,Excellence in diversity,"I traveled last night Manchester to Euston and got caught in the debacle of signal failure at Stafford. We were delayed nearly 2 hours but we were kept informed all through and the train manger could not have been more helpful and professional. Virgini then arranged onward transport via taxi to my final destination because no further trains were available. The easy way it was handled and the clear actions of your train manager, whose name I do not know, will stand you in good stead through adverse times. Credit to you all. Keeping us informed was the key, we all knew what if anything was happening."
403,Compassionate and Helpful,"I was with my husband recently on a trip to London and he was taken ill during the night. I was anxious to get back home as quickly as possible and on arrival at Euston I was lucky enough to speak to Michael, the Train Manager for the West Coast line to Manchester. He was so helpful and assisted us with our seating and made the journey home more comfortable for my husband. Michael and his female boss are 2 young people who are a credit to Virgintrains and I want to highlight that fact by this review."
404,Call centre,So many problems with system with call centres being abroad and frustrating.
405,Rude Staffs,"I have been discriminated by a member of staff after asking to have my 16-25 years old discount card renewed. Although I'm a mature student, fallowing the company law, in order to have a discount card the university have to stamp the application form. ( which I had) one of the their member of staff said right on my face that as a mature student she thinks that I should not be allowed any discount card. How dare this women talks to customers like that? If I was applying for the card is because I was entitle to do so! And who is she to tell me otherwise? I used to love virgin company but their lack of politeness and rude staffs are letting the company down. Not acceptable."
406,Aftermath Customer Service- Laughable,"Recently travelled on a virgin train, unfortunately the train was delayed which meant I would then miss my connection train. I understand that these are unavoidable and you just have to make the best out of a bad situation. The staff on the train were very helpful and could not have done more. They explained to me to get on the next train and pay the difference in fair then attach all my evidence and sent to virgin who would compensate me for me loss."
407,Excellent website,I always receive text messages of my journeys and I get refunded for delays
408,Overpriced and a total rip-off,"It is ridiculously expensive and a total rip-off! The seats are small, unclean and some carriages absolutely smell terrible! Reservation is a nightmare. There are delays all the time and the staff can be so rude and unhelpful."
409,Thank you,Would like to thank the lady guard on the virgin train from Newcastle to Peterborough we were travelling with my elderly parents and my mam doesn't walk very well this lady went way beyond her duty to help not only helping my Mam off the train but getting us a complimentary coffees and organising a wheelchair to get us to the platform so we could continue our journey to Norwich thanks again for all the help you are all truly amazing
410,"UTTER RUBBISH,  NON CARING,  NON UNDERSTANDING,  RIP OFF MERCHANTS","Due to Virgin Trains  website problems  dare went up  and visited me!  I was going to Torquay  from London  to help a mentally severely depressed, llow income friend  DIY his run down house.  I couldn't  travel  in the end and Virgin refused  to refund  even a penny as kindness though tickets were  Jon refundable and they're  the cheapest  I could buy and I'm unemployed.  I write to their MD and Richard Branson.  No responsescat all. I even had problems  with other Virgin branded companies.  Virgin are a severe capitalist money making group  and don't  care about their customers. I have cancelled  all my contracts with Virgin companies because  of their poor service and customer focus in abilities."
411,Worst customer service,Worst customer service
412,virgin trains website is a mess !,virgin trains website is a mess !
413,First class but not....,"I have had reason to travel with Virgin trains twice in the last few months, one return trip to Manchester a while back and the other return to Liverpool, just last weekend."
414,"A positive 'what can we do to help?' attitude, much appreciated.","I had to call Virgin, to get customer assistance for my mother ( who is much more incapacitated than she would admit) I phoned on the day, an hour or so before the train. The attitude was so positive, and in the end the assistance was sorted. She also said that the care on her inward  journey ( also not organised) was also excellent. So a big thank you for that 'how can we help?' attitude. It was very much appreciated, especially as we were at fault for not organising ourselves sooner."
415,Only by chance did I see that my train …,"Only by chance did I see that my train to Glasgow in three weeks time had been cancelled, no email, nothing. They took my money when I booked, £133, and will not refund on the unusable tickets until I send them back by recorded delivery. I have no other means to pay for replacements until this is refunded to me, by then it will be too late to book anything else at a reasonable price. Total miss selling and rubbish treatment of customers. Anyone hoping to get to Glasgow from Manchester via Carlisle on 29th April will be sadly disappointed and won't know a thing about it until they turn up for the non existent service. The Customer call centre in India is appalling. Cant say how upset and annoyed I am."
416,Mobile website is downright dishonest,"Mobile website is downright dishonest. Booking process made it sound like I was reserving seats. Then after payment taken I receive an email saying no reserved seats. Also no option was given about which station to collect the tickets from, when you used to get this choice. Truly abysmal."
417,terrible customer services,Impossible to get compensation when one carriage was removed from our train so our group of 8 friends ended up sitting on the floor in the hallway for over 3 hours. Over 5 months now and no one dealt with the query as yet despite chasing. Very unprofessional service amd I would not recommend to use them
418,Phone line customer service an absolute disgrace,"I had been waiting for 3 weeks for delay repay compensation for a 2 hour delay from Euston to Birmingham New Street, which made me miss the main act of a UK Hardcore gig I flew in to see from NZ. Two weeks ago, I receive 10 pounds in the form of a cheque, from a ticket that costed 20 pounds. Now I am no mathematician, but it clearly stated on their letter attached with the cheque, that delays running over an hour will be reimbursed 100%. Furthermore, I enquire about further compensation of the Rave ticket+accomodation fees of the hostel as a ticket booth operator at Birmingham New Street mentioned I could request it. It's been 5 weeks now and no reply other than some automatic email response. I call Virgin trains Westcoast lines, in which they respond ""They are currently busy atm"" during office hours..I even went as far as to fb message a rep, who promised they would be in touch with me...Appalling customer service, would not recommend one bit."
419,Awful Company,Impossible to get compensation for delayed trains from this company. Over a month and no reply at all beyond the automatic acceptance emails (even when registering a formal complaint) is unacceptable. It smacks of sharp practice (i.e. make it as difficult as possible to claim compensation for delays so that most people give up). Appalling company. If you have a choice then pick a different rail company.
420,Disgraceful lack of customer care.,"Just take a megabus, at least they have plug sockets - dirty, overcrowded, uncomfortable as hell experience. For the prices they charge, the customer care is shocking"
421,Never again,I lost my return ticket from Euston  to Preston and had to buy another at a cost of £88. I showed the  customer service person my email proof of purchase but she wasn't interested. I understand the responsibility is mine but surely they could issue some sort of receipt for the ticket collector.
422,no sense,"virgin trans allow bookings on nominated trains without a reserved seat this could involve a 5 hr journey with children, standing. Surely this is wrong."
423,Travelling Virgin? Bring an oxygen mask,Why are new Virgin train carriages worse than older ones in terns of access to 02? Why are we burning co2 gases to heat trains and burn up oxygen to the point that it feels like travelling in 40 degrees in India rather than 10 degrees in March in the UK... Horrible journey; a 21c train with no window openings or air conditioning facility!  Great incubation carriages for bug transfer but impossible to sit  for any length ( I sweated for 1/2 hour before leaving for teh corridor outside!)
424,Worse than trains in India,"Worthy of particular contempt was a smelly, unwashed, self-important and greasy curly haired halfwit in Edinburgh (get a haircut and put on some deodorant) who told barefaced lies about the process of booking seats"
425,Grace Bowler Euston to Chester,"My mother was reavelling up to see me,her daughter in Chester"
426,Thre my daughter off the train.,my daughter uses these trains all the time and she forgot her railcard so went and notified the office at her train station n they said if she had her online account as proof that would be fine so she got on the train and whem they came along ahe showed her ticket and then asked for her railcard and my daughter told the conducter everytging and he threw her off she did nog know where she was and we had to pay £83 for a ticket she got kicked off a train even tho she had a ticket......my point is that coz she needed proof if her railcard in the 1st place to buy her ticket she done as she was told by the station assistant and he still threw her off the train she was in tears upset is an understatment she is 20 and travels alone so yeh i am taking this further shame you have to give 1 star to make a comment in the 1st place...seeking legal action over this its not on.
427,Stole £117 from me,"Only printed the first half of the return journey from Edinburgh to London, the staff refused to do anything and I had to pay £137 for a single to get back home. On emailing to complain they confirmed there was an error and they'd look into it. 3 and a half weeks later they write back to say the computer has said printed the tickets and it was my fault for leaving it in the machine but the would return the original £20 I paid for the advanced ticket leaving me £117 out of pocket."
428,Appalling Customer Service Delay and Repay,I have been trying to get delay and repay which should have gone through automatically as booked on my Virgin.Com  account get no replies from emails sent to them? no helps from online chat service and the customer service telephone number wont take calls refers you to online chat ! Have even tried emailing Phil Whittingham MD of Virgin West coast no reply from his email either appalling something needs to be done about them!!
429,Disgraceful Customer Service,"After 6 months we have still not received delay compensation. Initially filled in their online claim form. Waited 3 months no sign of any compensation. Wrote to them and was bounced around a bit until I was asked to resubmit details of journey again. After waiting again for over a month contacted them again and pointed out that they had already received their payment from Network Rail for the delay so where was mine. Waited again and then asked what train I was on. Fortunately I still had the seat reservation sent that off and reminded them that the whole trip was booked via their web site so they should have a record anyway. Usual reply ""wait ten working days "". It doesn't take 6 months to buy a ticket so why should we have to wait 6 months for compensation. From my contact with them it would appear that they are not interested in customer service. Disgraceful."
430,A first class service,"We joined the train at Edinburgh travelling first class to Kingscross, ( £200 for 3 people cheaper then flying ) every thing about the carriage was first class especially the seats, the train left absolutely on the dot and almost straight away was offered complementary snacks and drinks from some very friendly staff,this service continued through out the journey, I would say that the staff went out of their way to make our journey as pleasant as possible,the ride was very smooth and quiet with the train arriving bang on time at Kingscross. What a excellent service what a excellent experience.A big thank you to all the staff on the 1330 Saturday."
431,Poor reward system,Under East Coast trains had free travel on under used trains as a reward- this was FAB! Sadly Virgin has discontinued this excellent service. Bring it back!
432,Annoying a lot,"The day is 24/10/16. Every 15 second they have been announcing ""attention train cruw disabled passenger alarm operating "" OMG IT was really really annoying to every passenger after every 15 second for 3 hour probably. Disgusting,  rubbish"
433,First Class disaster,"Paid for a first class ticket and received none of the benefits as the catering staff had left the train early. Staff were rude and unhelpful. Train was delayed. Do not use, they don't even deserve one star.Will not be travelling with Virgin again."
434,Ignorance,"06/10/2016. Newcastle Upon Tyne Central Station, Virgin staff could'nt have been more helpful to me in my electric wheelchair, Birmingham New Street Station, Virgin staff could'nt have been more helpful. 07/10/2016, leaving Birmingham NEC after the first day of the Star Trek convention, the virgin staff on the platform ignored me, missing two trains the last at 18:29. The result was going back through the NEC where the staff were wonderful directing me to the taxi rank, which I used the following two evenings. This was the first and last time I use Virgin Trains with my wheelchair"
435,First Class mistake!,My first experience of First Class on Virgin from London to Leeds.
436,Good service,"I travel Newcastle to London fairly frequently using first class,book ahead being flexible it not overly expensive. Yesterday 9pm out of Kings Cross excellent crew on food service! Thank you"
437,Fantastic,I was on the 6:15 from Doncaster to Darlington Friday the 7th to see why girlfriend and there was a hen party sat in front of me and the ticket conductor was amazing for 6:15 he was bright and cheerful! And then he took the time and effort to congratulate the bride to be and even bought them a bottle of prosecco it's only a little thing but it really was refreshing to see such a happy gentleman unfortunately I didn't catch his name but a credit to your company none the less!
438,"Website is awful, gave me different seats to ones I've booked","Just made a booking through Virgin trains website and selected my allocated seats, seats we're selected fine but when it came to confirming my order I have been given a totally different seats to ones I've requested, I paid a lot of money for these as their first class and for my partners birthday, after ringing Virgin a number of times and emailing them they said they may be able to change them within 2 working days but cannot guarantee those seats, terrible service!!"
439,Terrible,"Booked day return to Edinburgh coming back on the 22.27 on 1.10.16. from platform 8 Waverley Station,  Train was delayed and every time details were shown on the board it just got later and later finally coming in to platform 2 after 11.p.m,  As there was a delay of over 30 mins I was told could claim a refund - this refund would amount to £2.90! however as the website won't accept the details refund is nothing at all.  I guess they hope it's not worth the bother.  Terrible service both re the journey and their refunds policy.  Will avoid Virgin Trains in the future"
440,"Bad experience, steer clear.","Complete waste of time and money. We sat down at the cleanest looking table, none had been wiped or cleaned. The Gentleman (or not) serving us in a carriage (Which was empty save for being occupied by my husband and I) threw us a sandwich (only ham and egg to offer) and threw down the napkins. Brushed past us again only to sit himself down behind us eating his lunch for the duration of the journey. Disgusted and feel ill treated considering we have paid double to upgrade..."
441,Rubbish Booking Dates,What kind of system allows you to book now Alnmouth to Kings Cross for Dec 20th but not for 17 December ?
442,No luggage space,Busy train from Crewe to London.Staff member refused to help me find somewhere to put my luggage ' Not my responsibility.' Train manager later said it was not the responsibility of Virgin to provide luggage space for passengers:' We don't build the trains.' Do Virgin staff take course in unhelpfulness? Is it surprising that the majority of the population want trains renationalised?
443,"Train is fine, paid wifi is a joke","The paid wifi constantly logs itself out, is incredibly slow and has no option for a refund. I wasted 5 quid on it and no one should as it was horrible and slow"
444,Look up customer service!,"Yet again, I have to complain about Virgin Trains. I booked seats.to London from Newark for Sunday afternoon.  Got on the trsin to find it full to capacity with every lobby full of unhappy passengers. This has happened 8 out of my last 10 trips. Sadly as virgin are the only operators on my route I have no choice but when you complain they do nothing."" speak to the guard' was suggested but as the guard was obviously hiding from all the unhappy customers this was never going to happen. Virgin have gone from bad to worse and should lose their routes to a company who is capable of running a train service. Spent the whole journey crammed in by the toilet with about a dozen other passengers. Perhaps you should introduce a standing ticket rather than ripping us off."
445,Virgin Trains down the pan!,"I'm travelling so called first class from Preston to London. What a joke! The seats are hard and uncomfortable. They resemble second class seats in British Rail days but are not as comfortable. No proper breakfast just a bun, watery coffee in a plastic cup and a piece of fruit! WowI I paid £40 extra for this! My advice is to save money and book standard class in future. Virgin certainly need to buck their ideas up. Some proper competition on this route is badly needed."
446,Always friendly...,Use Virgin often as back and forth to Manchester.  Ok not the cheapest way sometimes but always friendly and on time!
447,"East coast: old trains tatty, new ones pretty nice, staff not particularly customer centric","I've done 4 trips this year: London-York and London-Edinburgh, all 1st class advance booking."
448,Very bad customer service,"e-tickets are non refundable and you can't change the date and time of this ticket either, had to spend more money. Ended up spending £81 in total and only going to take 1 journey. If I had a choice I would not travel via Virgin Trains but no other choice. Train smells and people make noises in the quiet section also kids are often in the quiet section screaming."
449,Prices For Greed,"Travel by rail is too expensive, especially with Virgin Trains where there aren't any special offers. I would rather take a train than drive but due to greedy prices I drive as I am not going to be ripped off."
450,abandoned,"I booked a seat in the quiet coach. Horribly drunk  foul mouthed , abusive football supporters got on at kings cross and stayed on till Leeds - ticket inspector walked through several times very quickly, didn't check any tickets. They should have been thrown off."
451,Not even worth 1 star,"I will never be using Virgin Trains again, most hopeless company I have ever dealt with. Spent endless amounts of time and money attempting to buy tickets with being sent to every department possible apart from the right one. on-line system wouldn't work and all staff on the phone were rude and even got hung up on trying to buy a ticket. Don't waste your time with them."
452,Rude conduct is common,"I tend to find that staff on Virgin trains are rude towards passengers waiting in the hallways of first class carriages. They are also very judgmental at classifying people without even asking for their tickets. So, if you don't look like an MP or a businessman then I am afraid you are out. I feel sorry for the lady with a pushchair as she clearly was a victim of the situation."
453,Bad customer service,After reading previous comment I cannot agree more with what's being said. Train manager on the 10:50am service from Birmingham was a disgrace. All they think about is revenue. There is no customer service.
454,Worst experience,On the 12.03.2016 at 10:50 train from Birmingham to Euston was delayed by about 9 minutes due to five members of staff forcing a pregnant woman with a pushchair off the first class vestibule area. Apparently woman was not allowed to stay there without having a first class ticket.
455,bought first class ticket end up with standing at economy!!,"one of my friend recommended to buy a first class virgin ticket london to birmingham from euston on 9th march, all virgin trains from euston was cancelled!! they told me alternative way from Marybone and i can used my first class ticket, but when i get there there is no first class?! when i ask them for refund the money they told me i was lucky to get a train!! i did not have had any time to argue but is not fair."
456,Great Service,Excellent service and delightful staff.
457,Superb journey,"Travelled for the first time in first class at it was first class, would recommend to anybody if the ticket prices were as close as mine (not much to upgrade) made my journey very easy and were accomdating after the tube made me late for my train. Thanks!"
458,The worst customer service I have ever encountered..,"This company must have the worst customer service I have ever come across. My wife has a medical condition that means she cannot sit with strangers. Virgin chose seats that were not together, and I of course requested a full refund. They then said that a £10 refund fee would be charged unless I produced some form of medical evidence that her condition existed!! All this for £10.  Add to this the fact that a doctor's note would cost the same amount and the cost of a 90 minute phone call and you can see why I think their so called 'customer service' is virtually non-existent."
459,Not good for business travel,"I have been travelling to and from Crewe to Euston and found I cannot get mobile access to message the office, check platforms for connections etc. This seems to be a train feature (I think metallised windows) and may be to 'encourage' me to use Virgin's pay wifi service. Its an expensive journey this route anyway and if I cannot get any work done I may as well go by car. I will be doing exactly that from next week, or go via Newport on Arriva. Even on that hilly route through Wales I do better."
460,2 months on and still waiting for refund,Booked a train at the start of Jan and was charged twice by Virgin Trains website. Complained several times via email but only received automated responses. 2 months later I finally hear from them but only to say that this is a Virgin East Coast issue not a Virgin Trains issue and that I need to contact them directly as it is a separate company. Absolutely appalling customer service.
461,Disgusting toilets,"Am travelling on 02/08 on the 07.03 from Darlington to London Kings Cross. Train fairly empty. Toilets next to coaches E & D are disgusting. The floor is very wet, toilets blocked. Yuck. Goodness knows what they'll be like later in the day."
462,Trading standards complaint made.,"I booked a ticket online ticking the reserve seat option. After payment taken received confirmation but no reserved seats.  Contacted via Facebook who said booking was not available on my selected journey and advised to make a complaint via customer service.  Did so,  did not receive a response. Contacted virgin by Facebook again who said they needed more time to respond. I reminded them my journey was in the morning. Distinct lack of concern or apology in their next reply. A report to trading standards is being made as I was simply mis-sold the ticket and service."
463,No where near as good as they used to be.,First class travel isn't what it used to be.
464,Travelling first class and only allowed breakfast if travelling over 70 mins - offered a stale croissant or cold toast instead,Travelling first class 7.08 London Kings Cross to York on Virgin East Coast. Asked for a cook breakfast but told I couldn't have one as getting off at Peterborough (50 mins later) and not enough time to make it. 16 mins after leaving Kings Cross other first class passengers started getting full English. When I asked again I was told I was not eligible as I was travelling less than 70 mins and was given a choice of a stale croissant or cold toast. There were also customers who seemed to know the staff and who got off at Peterborough and were served bacon rolls. Great customer service Virgin - try being flexible with your first class customers. Carriage had the aroma of full English breakfast to add to the torment. I was not even allowed to buy a full English but could have bought a cheese and ham toaster. Customer service response - read the terms and conditions on the menu! Save your money and go second class for short journeys if you are expecting food.
465,Awful customer service,"I booked a return ticket to Glasgow from derby, got as far as Crewe and everything was cancelled. Spoke to customer services at Crewe was told that I'm entitled to a full refund. Ok I thought great, 123.00 the tickets cost. I contacted the customer service number was given a reference number, sent my tickets back to them recorded delivery. That was over 2 weeks ago and not heard a thing since. Absolutely shocking avoid this money grabbing company they do not care about the customers one little bit."
466,Cancellations,"Yesterday the 2nd January my Son and his partner were due to catch the 9.15 from Berwick on Tweed to London, this was cancelled so was the 10.15, they eventually caught a train after 11am. Had to sit on the floor until York, This really is appalling service. It has happened so many times since Virgin took over this line. The cost of the tickets have risen considerably but not service. Richard Branson should be ashamed of this line. Instead of being home at lunch time they arrived at 5pm!"
467,No railcard no travel!,"I was travelling from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston at 10:35, one of 2 journeys on my way to spend New Years in Paris!"
468,Are they lying or are they incompetant?,"I was travelling yesterday (28th December 2015) from Peterborough to Edinburgh on a Virgin Train, and upon boarding the train was told by the conductor (over the public intercom) that [electronic] seat reservation systems where not in place due to an unspecified issue at the Kings Cross Terminal (which the train was from)."
469,"Automatic Compensation for Delays - well, that's the theory!","Having been notified by Virgin Trains of their new automatic compensation repayment system, it didn't take long for one of my journeys to be delayed more than 30 mins. I checked that I had qualified for the auto compensation (advanced payments, booked train, virgin operator) and waited in anticipation....but nothing automatic. After 6 days I ended up entering a manual claim."
470,Brilliant overall service,"Found the website easy to use, the staff helpful , the trains on time , clean , a overall service a quality service compared to my local service ."
471,"What a joke, virgin is terrible.",The staff in first class spent so long sucking up to American tourists and such and us the normal family from Scotland who had paid for 5 tickets just the same were treated like scum.
472,Mistakenly got stuck on the train,I would like to say how calm and helpfull the staff are on virgin trains. My friends came to stoke for the day and was returning back to London on the same day. To help one of my friend and her child i jumped on to the fast London train with them to put their suitcase in a safe place. By the time i placed the suitcase the doors shut and the train moved! I was in such a state and had mixed feelings and anger everywhere!
473,Jobsworth staff make interactions very unpleasant,The 2 minute door locking policy gets defended to the nth by the staff. It makes no sense on any level to advertise train times that are different from the time you need to be in the platform. Why why why do Virgin staff get so defensive about it rather than sympathising with customers and promising to fight it from below?
474,Rude food and beverage operater,"Upon travelling from Scotland and catching a connection @ Birmingham new street, being extremely hot and as ever the trains are delayed so I had 1 minute to catch the connection with an 9 month old son, I needed a drink. On board I went to seek the food and beverage cart to be met by a member of staff called ""Jon"" (10:04am to Bournemouth) who was extremely rude and nasty who laughed when I said I had a quench of thirst. He wouldn't serve me dispite his cart was full. He would only serve me in the aisle, this I don't mind but when I explained the train is packed and he would be a while he said ""well well well either move or simply wait"" move yes but on a packed train? Simply wait yes but am I not entitled to purchase a drink as a paying customer (£126:00). As I said I had already been to the other cart at the other side of train and it wasn't open his response was ""get over it"" Iam disgusted at this poor attitude! I will be taking this matter further due to the derogatory comments he also spoke but I didn't want to post on public as children read. I feel I needed to share this."
475,Absolute joke,"First time I've ever traveled with virgin trains, and not a very pleasant experience. Completely messed up seat reservations, attidtude of staff on board completely appalling, I plan on launching an official complaint but such a low quality company that I expect they'll completely ignore the customer. Next time I'll use a different train company."
476,Daylight robbery. Pure exploitation.,"We just walked the first 9 days of the Pennine Way. Ran out of time, so made a dash from Middleton-in-Teesdale to Darlington. Two buses with absolutely charming drivers got us there with 10 minutes to spare. Virgin trains charged us £178 for 2 adult and 1 child singles back to London, and we had a railcard!"
477,Standing room only for hours,"When we boarded the train in Prestatyn on a Monday during a bank holiday the train was already overcrowded--at least in second class. A woman standing in the corridor by the toilet -- she was with her two adult kids, who were sitting on the floor, and small grandchild in a stroller shoved up against the exit door -- said the overcrowding isn't unusual on Virgin trains, and that the first-class section had plenty of seats available but the authorities won't let second-class passengers move up there even when the situation was this bad and dangerous - people and their belongings jammed in to fill ALL the floor space, including by the toilets, to the point it was impossible to walk through. The class system has yet to take its final gasp in Britain (no, I'm not from the UK). Knowing it was a holiday weekend, Virgin should've planned ahead better."
478,"Terrible service, and they ignore consumer rights. Completely unacceptable","I reserved a seat in the quiet coach with a table and next to a power socket as I had a lot of urgent work to be getting on with.  The air conditioning in the quiet coach was broken.  After 2 minutes in the coach I was unable to take the heat any longer (the coach had evidently been sitting in the sun for quite a while it must have been a good 35+ degrees).  Therefore I had to move to another coach, which was noisy, with no power socket or table.  I asked for a refund as I did not obtain what I paid for.  After over 8weeks I received a train voucher, which did not even cover the cost of my original ticket.  Obviously they do this because it is cheaper for them, but as consumers we have the right to obtain a full refund if we buy something which is not fit for purpose.  It's not as if it was a 15minute journey!"
479,Brilliant Service,"Travelled from Manchester to Euston 25/6 for a long weekend break, my husband is wheelchair dependant and we booked assistance which I have to say was exceptional at both Manchester and Euston, the train was bang on time with help  waiting at both ends.. The train manager came for a chat and said to shout up if he could assist in anyway, perfect start and end to our mini break, Thanks Virgin"
480,First class disappointment,I would like Richard Branson to travel on one of his first class train trips to see just how first class it is Not
481,No seats in First Class,I decided to get a First Class season ticket as I was tired of standing twice a day between Peterborough and London.
482,Poor service,"I bought tickets on line. Went and collected tickets from fast tickets. 5 coupons  to come out. Didn't have the ticket. Not knowing the problem, went for the train and wasn't allowed to board. Came back to the ticket booth and  all of them unanimously said it is well known."
483,Seat Reservation not honoured and customer service dreadful!,Coach in which I had a reserved seat Edinburgh-London was taken off without warning and no alternative seating provided.  Train was full so had to stand the whole way.  Wrote to complain - first reply was stock answer about delayed trains which obviously irrelevant to the complaint.  When wrote back to point this out and reiterate the actual complaint took them 10 days and then replied to tell me they needed a different reference number from the one supplied to identify the booking.  Sent immediately and phoned to check it was OK this time.  Now told it will be another 10 days before they will review the complaint again.  This is simply not how customer service should work!
484,great service,"My friends and I use the trains regularly going to Blackpool we have started using assisted  travel whitch is fantastic, if u r having a bit trouble with walking ect or with your case's it really helps a lot, the staff especially in Glasgow Central are all lovely and very helpfull my friends and I all appreciate all your help. Thank you."
485,Disgusting,130 for a return fare to Newcastle:
486,Not professional service you would expect,Reservation system on train not working and toilet on my carriage not working. You wouldn't mind so much if you was not paying stupid prices for tickets but you are so expect the service to go with it.
487,"Disgusting train, overpacked and delayed","Got the train from Glasgow to Preston and it was delayed by over 2 hours, not the trains fault but got moved onto another train that already looked too full. I had paid extra money for our seat at a table and forward facing as I don't travel well and wanted good seats and ended up having to stand at a door for about 1.5 hours of that journey with 2 suitcases and hand luggage as no space anywhere. Then missed my connecting train to Manchester airport and got forced to buy another ticket to get another train as they wouldn't let me use my original ticket for the earlier train. So not a good start to my holiday."
488,Deliver what people pay for!,"Took a train from Glasgow to Preston.  I was surprised to discover that unlike on ScotRail trains, wifi is not free. Purchased a £10 flexible wifi access code and then used most of it trying to connect to a service that dropped repeatedly and was unbelievably slow.  If you are going to charge people for wifi access then you must provide a reasonable level of service!"
489,Not value for money for First Class service,"Train booked from B'ham International for 8.00am as we were early we thought we'd go into the First Class lounge but found it to be closed and once on our journey were offered just parties, one piece of fruit and a drink and on way back just offered a light snack of cheese and crackers and then kicked out of the First Class Lounge at 8.00pm from Euston even though our return journey wasn't until 8.30pm, you'd expect a lot more for a First Class service even if it was over a weekend..."
490,Unbelievably bad customer service,"Booking made a month prior to travel, sent in rail vouchers to pay for part of my journey but these somehow became lost in the post. Called to pay for the rest of my journey, passed to many different departments. Repeatedly told incorrect information. Promised numerous call backs but recieved none. Told that the 'back office' needed to take payment as no other department had the facilities to do this. But I could never seem to get through to them. A day before travel and its still not sorted out, extremely stressful and totally incompetant and unhelpful organisation."
491,The worst train rides of my life!,From London to Manchester:
492,Very expensive and terrible service,"I use Virgin trains, West Coast line, every year when visiting UK for work and family visits. In 2014 my experiences were very poor. This year I only needed to take one trip, from Carlisle to London, and was very disappointed to find if anything a deterioration. I booked first class as I normally do, and it was nearly 100 pounds for this three hour trip. It is daylight robbery, really. But if the service had been good I would not have complained. I boarded at about 9.50am and was hoping for some mid-morning coffee and cakes but half an hour or so later, they came round with breakfast (bacon sandwich and fruit).  Why anyone would want breakfast at 10.30 am is beyond me. I asked for a biscuit or something and all they could give me was a croissant. While making a decision about breakfast I asked what time lunch would be. I was told 'after Preston' which told me nothing, really, but seemed odd as the train was due to arrive at Preston at about 11am which was very soon afterwards! (Actually it was about an hour after Preston that lunch came round (what was fine), and I since realised that 'after Preston' meant that there was  a new shift of staff and the current staff could not give a flying fig what happened to customers aftrer they themselves left the train)."
493,day light ROBBERS,"My grandchild and two of her friends needed to get to London for an England team training camp. Since they where only children, they needed an adult to take them. My granddaughter, is staying with her other grandparents in England, as she lives in Australia, so my son asked if I could take them. No problem, till I chose Virgin Trains and booked an advance ticket. Unfortunately a couple of days  after booking, I found that I  was unable to take them. Two frustrating days followed, left on hold for 30 mins, trying to get through on numerous occasions. At long last, I was through to INDIA! Patronising, and unable to understand my request. A supervisor finally told me in no uncertain terms that having booked an advance ticket, and that as I was the adult, ALL the tickets where in my name. Even though I had found another adult to take my place, I could not change that name. Basically, I was told to rebook with the new adults name, AND REPAY FOR NEW TICKETS. NO REFUND ON THE ORIGINAL. In my book Virgin trains, that is THEFT."
494,Not a pushchair / pram friendly train,"No help from customer services to find space for parents that need to use a pram / pushchair for their babies to rest during long journeys. I cannot believe they say pushchair / prams are welcome as long as they kept folded, my issues to this policy are the following:"
495,First Class,"What a con. Thought I was going to be given the luxury treatment after reading the ads. Coffee, soft drink and dried up cheese and tomato sandwiches, no alcohol, delayed train!"
496,Poor Communication Again,"I was one of many people disrupted yesterday (1st July) by the power line problems at both Manchester and London. I've been a regular commuter between Manchester and London for donkey's years and accept that sometimes things go wrong. However, lack of communication is still a major issue as demonstrated yesterday."
497,Customer Service - a joke,"I recently contacted customer services and the reply was curt, unhelpful did not answer the points I raised. My follow up letter suggested it was my fault for purchasing an incorrect ticket. Overall re arrogance of the letters was astounding."
498,Faceless Virgin!,"I tried to book 6 first class return tickets to London for business colleagues this week. The web site was on a go slow and then crashed. I finally managed to get as far as the reservation stage and noticed that the seats allocated were not together. Not a problem, I thought, I book train seats regularly. I clicked on the change seats, noted that there were plenty of 4 seats together and 2 opposite, selected and saved. No matter how many times I did this, the new seat selection would not save. I called customer service and was told that it was probably a fault on the web site. I could either book the seats and then try to change them,( not guaranteed) or just delete and start the booking procedure again. I chose the latter as it was imperative that we sat together to prepare for a meeting.  I tried to re-book immediately but the same journey had increased by  no less than £ 85.10 in the 5 minutes it took to do this!  Obviously I called customer serviced again - they said they couldn't help, no-one in the company could over-ride the web prices!!! I can't believe this is true. Is the company run by machines? I asked to speak to a manager - this was Thursday. I am still waiting for someone to call me back today (Saturday). Nevertheless, we needed to travel to London, I booked the seats, they still didn't allocate together, I tried again to change but the change still not actioned. I booked anyway and then called customer service again - A customer service tele-operator (Joy)  said she would put forward a request but could not guarantee! It would take 72 hours to learn if it was possible!! Is this really a reasonable response! It only took 5 mins to take nearly £600 from my credit card but 72 hours to learn if we can actually sit on the train together, despite viewing many together seats.  Joy did not bring much joy and was quite sharp, pointing out that although I could give feedback it wasn't going to make any difference and there was nothing I could do about anything or speak to anyone else.   I still haven't heard back from anyone! As my colleague said - 'Thank you for choosing to travel with Virgin' but do we indeed have a choice. The customer service I received this week was both frustrating, and in the latter part quite frankly rude!"
499,Virgin trains Glasgow to London,"First time on Virgin Train to London, will not be repeating any time soon."
500,No Customer Service Whatsoever,"I have sent two emails to you but you have chosen to ignore me, it's very typical of your Company from my experience, I do hope that I do not have to utilize your services again."
501,Cleanliness,I travel on Virgin trains a lot. My company pays thousands. I am really dissapionted that my company pays £181 for a trip to London yet I always find the seats are not clean. Often dust and food left rotting by other customers isn't cleaned up for my journey. I would not pay this much to travel as it's very uncomfortable to sit on a seat that is clearly dirty. I have experienced this many times now. My most frequent route is Birmingham to London.
502,Transported!,A brilliant bit of extempore storytelling this morning by the Train Manager on my Virgin Pendolino from London to Manchester – deftly turning a downside into a positive. First the apology – train running slowly as approaching a tunnel where a speed limitation is in operation. Then the mitigation: it should not add too much time to our journey today. And then the added value: because we are going so very slowly we have the rare opportunity to see the fantastic engineering work undertaken by the thousands of navies who hand-excavated the tunnel in the 1830s. And especially to see the two enormous brick-lined air shafts they constructed bringing light into the tunnel and allowing us to marvel at their handiwork.
503,Disaster! And no customer service!,I traveled with them recently and although I bookded well in advance I had to stand all the way from Birmingham to London after a full day at the fair! Just imagine that.
504,Good,"I have had a couple of bad journeys from London to Liverpool with Virgin Trains , also with customer assistance"
505,Awful Customer Service,"First I think the trains are pretty good most of the time.  BUT, when you have a poor journey and need to let Customer Service know, they take a long time to reply.  I paid nearly £500 for a first class ticket that was far from first class and the service very poor.  Customer Services tried to fob me off with a £20 voucher!  That wouldn't get me very far.  I wrote to express my disappointment and after sending proof of  the cost of my ticket, they offered me compensation.  A First Class return ticket.  They sent me a code to use, but turns out it was a 'promotional code' which could only be used during certain times  and would expire at the end of May- not much good for me when I am working most of the times it was available.  I contacted them again, was told I could have a new code, which would be valid for 6 months but I would have to wait for the first code to expire.  What a nonsense.  Sadly, a different person dealing with my complaint every time.  Not helpful, not sorry, not bothered about customers.  Shocking."
506,Awful,I am shocked at Virgin Trains the whole experience was awful.
507,Awful Customer Service,"I just booked tickets online and due to an issue with their website it chose the wrong seats and seats not next to each other even though i had clicked the seat finder and saved my chosen seats.  I rang the telephone number on their site to explain what had happened all I got was a very rude man who could hardly understand what I was saying and refused to help, let me speak to a supervisor or give me another number to call!!  I am waiting for feedback from an online complaint so their rating may improve if I get better help but the advisor was awful and so rude.  I am quite annoyed that I never had these issues with east coast before virgin took over but they need a massive improvement in helping their customers!!  All the guy on the phone wanted to do was book me new tickets!!"
508,Really?,"Here I am on the 19.00 train to Manchester, the 27th of February. Ok it is a Friday, it is busy and we know it. The train is a chaotic mess of people sitting on the floor, while the bar conveniently had ""problems"" with the card machines. In fact we read problems as a very well known fault in the train infrastructure that makes credit card payments a pain everyday. So ok, we do not want to have queues of people standing waiting for signal, so we tolerate. Then the train manager starts with the usual litany of scripted apologies and he is so moving when he profers ""I applogise because no one should be sitting on a floor during a travel."" Thanks for beating your chest boy, however your first class is empty and when we booked the ticket no message would tell us that the train was overcrowded and there was no seat available. A word of advice, do not take your Customers for cretins while you play your yeld management the dirty way."
509,Best customer service,"I was at traveling back to Coventry from Wolverhampton station on 11/2/15 at 13:00 and I had just missed my train. A very helpful lady called 'Debbie' made sure I caught the next avalible train, with the right ticket and all with a smile and friendly manner."
510,Fantastic customer service,Virgin trains customer service are amazing
511,Nightmare train journey made better,i travelled from Manchester - London Euston on 29/11/15 departing at 17.35. About 1 hr into the journey we had a message from the train manager explaining that a tree had fallen on the tracks blocking our way and they were currently investigating. Obviously this was annoying for all of us on board and it did cause significant delays to the journey back. Sarah the train manager was excellent at keeping all passengers up to date on what was happening and updating us whenever she could. there is nothing more frustrating that not being told what is going on and this was avoided. luckily they were able to divert the train on a different route. i got home nearly 2 hours later than planned but knew that the train staff did all that they could to make the journey as bareable as possible. After coming into work and praising the staff to all of my colleagues i then received an email saying that i was being automatically refunded for the journey with no forms for me to complete. i was so impressed with this and couldnt imagine this type of service from other train companies.
512,Disgusting incompetent staff should be sacked on safety measures,"We have just travelled from Edinburgh to Newark Northgate, the train stopped for no more than 20seconds then closed the doors and pulled off"
513,The worst company ever! Con and fraud spring to mind and customer disservice is a joke!!!!,Virgin should have their franchise removed they are an unpleasant joke.
514,Worst train trip ever!,"My partner and I traveled for his birthday on Virgin from London to York and back.  The trains were late on both journeys -- just as they were dirty.  On the return trip, our carriage simply did not exist.  We had to squeeze between a crowd of passengers fighting for seats.  Extremely disappointing."
515,Utterly the worst customer service I've ever encountered,"9th November 2015 saw a problem 'on the line', where a delay amounted to 5hrs and a journey in total of 8hrs."
516,Seat Allocations,"Since Virgin took over from Eastcoastline I have never, ever been allocated the seats in my preferences, facing forward, a table and a power socket. Last night I booked again and found that the 'change seat' tab wasn't working and therefore couldn't change my seat to one I prefer. I tweeted the help service who said that if I book now and ring customer services in the morning they would change my seat no problem. Okay, so I did that and found that for them to change my seat it would cost £10 for each alteration. I explained that it was Virgin's fault online that I couldn't get the seat I wanted because the website wasn't working properly and was told that the charge would still incur. This is a blatant rip off to allow Virgin to extort more money from customers, the sooner the railways are nationalised again the better."
517,Web support is not upto the task.,"I recently had reason to call web support to get advice on a ticket query, after thirty plus minutes of holding I gave up and tried again a few hours later, same result, over an hour wasted in two calls and still no answer. It wasn't like this before Virgin took over so what's changed? Get your act together Virgin, just because you have a monopoly doesn't mean you can take the mickey."
518,Very happy!,"I had a problem with my tickets and called up the day of my journey and the customer service I received was excellent, the man on the phone was very helpful and sorted my issue out straight away! The journey was also great, no problems and free wi-fi on board so can't complain! Thank you Virgin Trains 😊 X"
519,Gone Downhill,"I have used Virgin trains for years regularly between Liverpool and London and there has been a noticeable decline in standards. The tables are often dirty, the seats covered in bits of food and the smell from the toilets just awful. The food in first class has gone from being perfectly acceptable to poor. Breakfast service at the weekend - tea in a polystyrene cup,  a banana and panettone in a plastic packet. First class? I don't think so. Having the monopoly on the route has made them complacent and they are giving customers less and less but charging them more. I wish there was an alternative because I would switch."
520,"Come on it's 2015!, why is the wifi connection like dial up...","Now while the train is warm and comfortable, I get my laptop out ready to make the most out of my 5 hour journey, happy to pay the expensive price for Virgin internet (not really but hey, that's life...) so make my journey seems quick n easy, only to find the connection is like dial up and cuts off every 6-7 minutes, REALLY you are meant to be Virgin!...come on sort your s*** out!"
521,Ticket price swindle using discount rail card,"Virgin increase the unit price of a ticket if you use a railcard to get a discount. You are unable to access the cheapest tickets AND use any type of rail discount card. So, beware . . . Virgin trains greedy and not honest as they do not state that if you use a railcard for a discount they automatically charge you more for the ticket!"
522,Staff need to learn some respect,"Travelled from Keighley to London Kings Cross at the weekend, which meant changing from a Northern Rail train to Virgin's at Leeds."
523,The staff are always right,"Virgin, like certain airlines, have no interest in the customer. Whatever our complaint, they always seek to justify, never correct.  The booking system, disinterested staff, overcrowded trains (we shared the between- carriage space with 50 Newcastle fans one Sunday, standing from York, elbows wedged to our sides) and anti-customer service are now a complacent norm rather than an unacceptable state of affairs demanding root-and-branch reform."
524,Compensation vouchers a joke,"My comment is about using compensation vouchers.  My husband travels to London on the train quite a lot but was delayed in the summer.  He was duly sent £32.50 in vouchers - hardly compensation - more a con to use Virgin again.  Anyway the vouchers cannot be used on online bookings, you have to call a number or go to your nearest staton to book.  Hardly customer friendly.  Fares are more expensive booking this way and you cannot claim Nectar points as you can online - and at £220 thats a few! Then there is a huge palava of writing a letter and sending the vouchers in at least 10 working days before you travel.  They then call you to taken payment balance.  Sorry Virgin - customer service is a joke.  How many people just go 'oh I cant be bothered' and you have paid out no compensation at all!!!!  Thats why you make so much money!"
525,disastrous website revamp,"The new booking system on the main website is an utter disaster, full of glitches, freezes and general malfunctioning. TERRIBLE. Gave up and went to Red Spotted Hanky."
526,Virgin Trains - Beware of making an error when booking online,"I purchased a return ticket at 10:47 at 18:00 the same day I realised i had booked the wrong return date. I called customer service to amend the ticket and was informed I would have to buy a new ticket, pay a cancellation fee and then pick up the original return tickets at the self service machine and post them by recorded delivery to an address in Scotland to get a refund, which would take up to 5 - 7 days to complete upon receipt of the tickets. How in this day an age of digital business  can a train service have a policy so inefficient and unhelpful. You mean to tell me they could not have amended my original booking? I had booked the ticket 1 week in advance, the tickets hadn't been issued and I had called in less than 24 hours. The argument used by Customer Service is that it was my fault and this is the policy of the train lines."
527,Appalling standards,Took a 5.5 hour journey from London to Glasgow and this is a summary of my experience:
528,Better than in other countries,Mieux que les trains français !
529,Unhelpful obstructive staff,"After already having to deal with moody and unhelpful staff at Euston, giving inconsistent information, I've now lost 3 hours of my life because no one opened the bike carriage to let me off the train!"
530,Excellent journeys to and from Edinburgh,I booked in March for a journey in August and decided to go for the first class option - £31 each way with a senior railcard.  We travelled to Edinburgh at 3.30 pm and came back on a 7.30 am train.  The food and drink options were very good with no shortage of things to eat and drink - lots of alcohol available on the evening journey.  The staff were well presented and very competent.  The seats were very comfortable for a long trip.  All in all there were no complaints and I would most certainly use this service again.
531,Edinburgh to Kings Cross 9th September,"9th September 9.30 am Edinburgh to Kings Cross arriving 13.49 ( or so I thought ) Train broke down twice before we even got to Newcastle adding 30 mins each time. Then got to Doncaster where we were told the train would now be making 5 extra stops. It was supposed to be 3. These extra stops would now make us three and a half hours late. We are all being told we will get our money back, big deal why is it crap service companies think they can solve their serious management failings by giving money back? What about your customers time, frustration , events and meetings missed , how do you value that ? I will never under any circumstances ever use Virgin trains again. This journey had been an abject lesson in truly awful management , yes you see it's the managers who are always trying to save their own skin by using the companies money to bail them out when they screw up. Someone at Virgin Trains put a defective engine on the tracks, they didn't inform passengers when they got on in Edinburgh that there were already delays taking place south of Doncaster which they could have done because they knew and then someone decided to send the same train with the defective engine around 5 more stops."
532,so unorganised,"train from york to london has been all cancelled and after faffing around, one of the member of staff told me to go to this platform and the train will head straight to london king's cross. turns out it was heading to thirsk and i had to take the train from there back to york to get another train to london again. absolute nightmare."
533,Fantastic,"Again, i seem to be running against the tide here when I compliment Virgin Trains (West Coast). I regularly catch the train from Stafford to Euston and have enjoyed superb service and punctuality. The booking and seat allocation are always easy to do via the web and picking up the tickets at the station before you travel is simplicity itself. Well done Virgin Trains"
534,Motion Sickness and Bad Smell = Actual Sickness,During my journey I observed many  passengers in carriage A (at the back of the train) feeling queasy.
535,Refund for late train,"We buy four tickets from London euston to Edinburgh Weaverly on 29 July 16. The train get delay when it's spioilt after an hour run. On their website they clearly state that they will refund if the train is late for half an hour , even when we board the train, the caption announce there will be refund. We wait for the refund to be back to my sis account. No news ! Make a complaint online, no reply. Call them and it take forever for them to take the call. Finally when they take the call said the case not open yet. And we wrote email again. 2 weeks later, call again to check the status said it takes 2 weeks to process the claim. Well, we call them only after two weeks and still the same answer. Call them today and get the reply that we should write email to another email address. For one month, no action was taken! If you don't want to refund why on earth would you guarantee it online. Feel like getting cheated. Really have a bad feeling about this virgin train."
536,Train booking,Totally disgusted booked a window seat and facing foreward and my return journey was facing backwards stuck in the middle no window.
537,Virgin booking with nectar voucher joke.,"After cashing in nectar points to use towards virgin trains, I booked a month in advance. Got booking confirmation all seemed good. 3 days before due to travel still no tickets, so rang to enquire. After talking to 5 or 6 different CSA, non seemed to know where my tickets were, I didn't have a booking or I was phoning the wrong company?! Promises to ring me back never came to fruition and I eventually booked again. Same seats cheaper price. To turn up at the station to find train cancelled and next delayed. So couldn't have the seats I booked and was late.Fantastic start to our holiday with a three year old! Disgusting and I will never use again. 6 hours of phone calls, 2 days of panic in case we couldn't met our flight and miserable experience. No apologies or recompense for the huge telephone bill I will receive and took 3 weeks to return my nectar voucher, which will be promptly returned to nectar."
538,DISGUSTING SERVICE,"You should be ashamed ... My family paid £300 for tickets to & from our holiday , on our allocated booked train there was no avalible seats so me my partner our 3 young children , 2 elderly mums & new born baby were made to sit on the floor in the passageway , putting us in danger & this is down right unacceptable ! WE PAID FOR SEATS !"
539,Booking on virgin train website but travelling on Grand central,Journey 20/08/2016 at 17.02 train from York to Kings Cross London.
540,Needs a good clean,"I use virgin trains every week and I am pleased with the times etc BUT what really lets them down is the cleaning. Every train is dirty - dirty carpets, filthy tray tables and the toilets stink. I got on one yesterday and the smell in the corridor where the loo was smelt awful. A mixture of poo and old hoover bag!"
541,Avoid the promotions - they dont honour them,Tried to use promotion to get discounted ticket but website link wasn't working.  Web support confirmed validity and told me to book and claim refund.  I went ahead on this basis this but now Virgin refuse to make the refund.
542,London to Glasgow,The whole train smelled....like vomit...vestibules worse. Toilets mostly inoperable and the one I found open was filthy. This is not the first time. Tray tables not clean...nor between seats...horrible buildup. They should change the rugs once in a while and get the rags out and Ecover into a bucket!
543,Cynical marketing disguising price rises,"As a frequent customer I can confirm that Virgin may have kept EastCoast's actual 'prices', but the number of lower-price tickets available has been reduced considerably."
544,Mark Hamilton - Glasgow to Birmingham Route Friday 2pm departure,"Great staff, friendly, professional, nothing to much trouble."
545,GLENN train manager of virgin to London Huston,Journey 11/08/2016 at 15.55pm train to Crewe which ended up in London Euston
546,Only good customer service earnt this 2 star otherwise it would have been 0,Travelling with 4 adults and 7children from London Euston to Birmingham.
547,"Smelly carpets and seats and unheigenic toilet area, Very Polite Staff!","We boarded the train and if only they would re-upholster (or dry/steam clean) the seats and replace the smelly carpets with a clean surface flooring like a laminate, the experience could be much better. It is not hygneinic to have a carpet in an area which is so frequently walked upon and would be impossible to clean. The Toilet could be better DESIGNED and not look and smell so dirty. They could have odor or spray bottles on a timer. I still feel sick two hours after my journey."
548,Rip off prices,The price we pay for tickets are not worth it. The toilets are dirty and the toilet floor is often wet. Even when you reserve seats someone else is the seat you or Virgin have double that seat. it's pathetic. Where on earth do this company get away with daylight robbery e.g up to £500 for a journey. No one would ever pay that much for a ticket and that's not even 1st class. The fact is the government should never of privatised British Rail. it was fine as british Rail.
549,Awful,These virgin trains are jokes you reserve seats for 2 adults and a child but children get on free so you dont get a seat for them!! So now us and my 4 year old are sitting in between carriages for a 3 hour journey and the staff are no help atall. WHY DONT THE KIDS GET A TICKET SO THEY HAVE A SEAT!!
550,Cattle class,"Am not normally the sort of person that writes a review but having had so many bad experiences on Virgin east coast trains it seemed reasonable to do so. Every single train journey I have had the misfortune to endure has either been delayed by such a considerable amount that it has been valid for a refund or some kind of transport alternative or it's been so full that even standing has been impossible in standard(cattle) class. To add insult to injury, the staff are often very rude and unreasonable. Today, I saw a pregnant lady turned away from sitting in first class because she'd booked a standard class ticket. Fair enough, maybe but not when standard class is so full that she couldn't even get through to the seat she'd booked. Having experienced this journey with so many different train operators I feel Virgin east coast has brought any journey north of London to an all time low"
551,Couldn't have done more for us,During recent trip to Edinburgh train could only run to Preston but Virgin did what they could to get us to our destination. We were several hours late but they refunded all our fare very quickly. I dont think they could have done more. Thanks Virgin.
552,Overpriced for Overcrowded service,"200 pounds a week for overcrowded journeys from Peterborough to London. Most times can't get a seat, trains are dirty, constantly late and of course, there is always a very diligent guard ready to charge you if you don't have the right ticket. Never happened to me, but I wonder why Virgin can't be financially punished by constantly delivering a bad service. They offer peanuts compensation for cancellations, and even so, they always try to deliberately delay ""on time"" services, so delayed trains can go ahead to reduce their delays, before they get caught in the compensation threshold."
553,Not customer centric and over priced,"Having done quite a few Chester to London return journeys I can conclude that this is a very expensive and inflexible service - staff poorly trained, food poor at best and wifi a joke to name but s few. I think it is time for some proper competition and s bit of healthy tension to get this shower to up their game!"
554,Mess up with their central computer system cost me money,*Updated*
555,Great trains!,"I love Virgin Trains, I always pay extra to travel with them to London as I know I am getting better value for my money than with a competitor on the same route (London Midland). Trains may leave late on occasion but the time of arrival is always on time. Comfy seats, spacious surroundings, great cafe and friendly staff! Also, the website has no booking fees which draws me to book train journeys that aren't operated by VT with them as I don't want to pay £1.50 or whatever for a booking fee!"
556,Travelled in style,"Excellent service, food and wine with friendly staff. Particularly liked the guards sense of humour on the return 11.11 Doncaster to Edinburgh service today, who made us chuckle with his dry wit and funny stories. Made the journey! Comfy seats and plenty of leg room. Just an all round first class service in first class. We will be back 😀👍"
557,Liverpool to London train manager,"The Liverpool to London train has a particularly friendly, welcoming, informative, pleasant train manager/ticket collector."
558,GUTTED WITH YOUR SERVICE,GUTTED WITH YOUR SERVICE: After living in Australia for 12 years and being an avid supporter of all things Virgin to the point of being a Credit Card Holder and Platinum member. It disappoints me that the same service i received in Australia with Virgin is not available here in the UK. I have been back in the UK for 9 weeks and i have booked a ticket to travel to London for a wedding. Now as life has been hectic to say the least i realised i booked the wrong date for my return journey. HONEST Mistake on my behalf. So I call the service line to change my train date and was happy to pay an admin fee for the change as i made the mistake. I was informed quite quickly that you are unable to change the time and will have to buy a new full ticket and forfeit the full price i have already paid!! This is nor fair or reasonable in anyway. Whilst writing this i have been waiting for hold for a manager to be called for me to speak too. VIRGIN get a grip!! You have always prided yourself on being a business where the customer is treated fairly. I am disappointed and this has tarnished the reputation Branson has worked hard to put in place. Disappointed and feel cheated and robbed. At least Turpin wore a mask!! Shame on you Virgin!!
559,Still waiting for a refund six weeks later...,"Had a disastrous train journey on 9 March from Crewe to London - signal failure turned a 90 minute journey into 4 hours-plus. I duly lodged my claim for a refund of the ticket. That was in early March, still waiting in mid-April. They've been in touch by email to ask for details I put in the original claim, but I sent them again by return. Then they wrote to me asking me to provide exactly the same info, so I sent it again. No acknowledgement, still waiting for my money back. Very poor service."
560,Simply the best 😀,"Thanks to the wonderful staff who helped process a refund of non refundable tickets in light of exceptional circumstances causing my elderly grandmother to cancel her journey. I appreciate all your help, thanks once again!"
561,Terrible,Since Virgin took over the east coast contract they have managed to turn a barely excepable service into a terrible one.
562,Drinking & British trains,"Dear Virgin Trains, please add an allocated carriage for those people who wish to drink alcohol while traveling on your trains. This would make the journey for the rest of the passengers so much more pleasurable. It is a frequent occurrence of having to put up with a group of lads popping their cans open and yapping away loudly while the rest of the carriage having to grin and bear it. I am going to fly next time I need to travel from Glasgow to London as I am that fed up with having to put up with drinking on trains. Yours Truly, a Peace-Seeking Passenger"
563,Mixed Bag,The trains are usually acceptably clean and the staff on board are quite friendly. Falls to pieces at busy times though. If you plan to travel at a busy times reserve a seat or failing that pack a deck chair.
564,Still terrible,So bad customer service. The waiting time to get response is unbelievable .  I'm waiting about 8 months for refund my ticket .    Also I'm in train already which is 85 minute delay !!   The delay repay  scheme it is not fair !
565,Simply awful,"What kind of company demands extortionate fares, is continuously late and then when they don't respond to emails and delay repay for weeks they blame the fact that they can't cope with the amount of complaints!"
566,Don't bother with First Class,Paid the upgrade to First Class. seriously don't bother. Hoping for a glass of wine and something tasty to eat... A small diet Pepsi and four crackers and cream cheese. No wifi and no free water. Complete rip off!! Asked the attendant why its not available and her reply complete with a shrug if the shoulders was 'because its so cheap'.  Would have been better to go to thr Sainsburys local in Euston and buy £30 worth of food than wasting it with Virgin.
567,will not be travelling again!,"I got a train headed to Peterborough from London, the conductor came up to the bathroom banging on the door when I was in there for less than a minute claiming I was taking too long, I had explained to her I missed my train by a few minutes so came into this one and was told it would be okay for me to travel by a staff member at kings cross, she demanded I pay £33.20 on the spot for a ticket even though I showed her my reservation for the tickets online. with less than 20 minutes left of my journey, due to having severe anxiety people began to stare at me so I couldn't say anything and willingly paid the money. for a one hour journey in a cramped carriage with rude staff is something I will not be paying £60 for, Virgin trains you are an awful company and I will not be travelling with you again!"
568,A con,"Charge you through the teeth to change tickets. I didn't realise my name would be on the ticket (or that I would be the one who had to be on the train in the first place), paid to buy my friend a ticket and then found out that it wouldn't count. Why not? How can that not be a thing? Why was it not mentioned my name would be printed on the ticket? I've taken loads of trains and that's never been an issue. And so unbelievably overpriced."
569,Terrible experience,I decided to write a review after reading a report in regards to pregnant woman being charged for first class ticket whilst standing in the corridor. Complete disgrace.
570,poor service and customer relations,Took over 30 days to send the wrong reply to a complaint.
571,Best UK Train Line,Definitely one of the better train lines. Service can differ but there are some really great personalities that work the trollies. The customer service following delay repay claims are also far better than I have found when compared to other train lines.
572,Good Experience,"Like other reviewers, I noticed that they had a new web site since I last bought tickets, but honestly I just sailed through re-registration, and had tickets bought and printed off within 10 minutes."
573,The new website is a disaster for …,"The new website is a disaster for customers. It seems to have been purposefully desgined to be awkward, difficut and horrible to use to ensure no one ever uses it. I shall only use trainline from now on. I have tried twice now to change a ticket and get a refund on the ticket I can no longer use and had to re-verify my account twice, once I was already in my account and then found out it would take 48 hours for the ticket I was trying to change to show up..or something. I lost the will to live trying to figure out how I could get my ten quid back. it used to be simple and elegant to change a ticket. I hope that the extra money they are making is worth it to Virgin for the totally abysmal customer relations they are fostering."
574,Virgin East Coast web site is dire,"Recent changes to their website are dire, making it far more difficult to process tickets and refunds. And I could really do without the kids speak which only confuses. Use plain English, trying to be trendy with Wahey - you need to look up all of the conatations of the word before you use it so libarlly"
575,Purposefully Obtuse Customer Services,In a nut shell; if the website doesn't work don't bother trying the telephone number its simply not worth wasting life's precious moments on a fruitless exercise.
576,Four months and still waiting,"Does anyone ever get a refund from this company? Three trips by vtec and all three either delayed, disrupted or cancelled. Four months and twenty seven emails later nothing. One excuse after another. The train that died then came back to life and was only 29 minutes late is a classic.must have gone very fast, and empty, to make up the lost hour! In this day and age I would have thought a simple refund to the credit card that bought the tickets, but nothing is that simple."
577,Paid extra to travel 1st Class,"Paid extra to travel 1st Class, table was dirty and no food available (despite menu being on table). I complained to Virgin and in the email reply that took 2 weeks to receive was told the food was 'complimentary' and was not included in the ticket price.... i.e. I was basically being told it was tough that they had no breakfast or sandwiches buy they didn't have to supply food, if you get it count yourself lucky !  This is the second time this has happened to me with Virgin East Coast. In the earlier days with them this sort of thing didn't happen. All I can say is bring back GNER !"
578,Customer helpline is actually an …,"Customer helpline is actually an oxymoron: they don't help customers at all, in the slightest. At time of writing this, am sat on the phone (and have been for 14 minutes) with some pseudo-Geordie annoying voice telling me they be with me as soon as they can. Virgin, please define 'soon', because in my world, the real world, sat listening to your excuses for 13 minutes doesn't pass as 'soon.'"
579,Fantastic service Virgin East Coast web support team!,"I was extremely impressed by the service I received yesterday from the web  support team, in relation to a problem whereby I had requested my ticket to be posted to my home address, but due to illness I had not been able to get home to collect it. The operator who sorted out the problem for me (Ellen) could not have been more courteous and helpful. I was extremely impressed with the standard of service - the best I've had from anyone in ages - well done Virgin East Coast!"
580,"Misinformation, no seat, threatened with police",No coach G.
581,Shocking,"Shocking! Our train was delayed by 2 hours,try  claim our refund and no one acts on it, you end up ringing then, and what a mistake that is, been on hold now an hour! And still no one is sight. Dreadful customer service. Will never use you again,"
582,worst ride ever,worst ride ever. All my trains to manchester airport were cancelled and had to board another train to manchester picadilly. All seats were reserved so I had to stand for 2 hours. the train manager oscar a south african guy was very rude and unprofessional. he never offered to help me make my journey  more comfortable. I am diabetic and felt really dizzy standing up but Oscar told me it wasnt his problem.
583,Dreadful company,Dreadful company
584,I would like to praise Virgin East Coat …,I would like to praise Virgin East Coat Trains for the way they treated me.
585,Virgin Trains is a disgrace,"Virgin Trains is a disgrace. They are happy to take your money when buying a ticket, the phone is answered instantly, but when it comes to calling them regarding a refund, you have no chance of them answering the phone. On three separate occasions I have tried to phone their so called customer services and each time been on hold for over an hour and at a premium rate phone number it is not cheap. They dont even tell where you are in the Que to give you any indication you are actually moving nearer to speaking to someone. All it repeats is we will get you though to an adviser as soon as we can and then it plays the most irritating music you have ever heard, but the adviser never comes, and after wasting so much time and money on hold for an hour and ten minutes each time you just have to put the phone down.It is so frustrating.I really feel this is done on purpose so people just give up and let them keep the money, because the time and money and stress spent trying to get back what you are entitled to is just to much.  My daughter was stuck on one of their trains very late at night for two hours in almost total darkness as there was no power. We sent in the ticket and all details to claim the full refund for the fare as they say you are entitled to after an hours delay. The reply by email was she is not entitled to a refund because the train was only delayed for 1 minute. You cant reply to the email and they state you have to ring them if you have any further questions. But strangely enough no one answers the phone. This company must be making an absolute fortune from not giving customers back there refunds when they are entitled and people just give up trying due to such terrible customer service. It is disgraceful how they are allowed to carry on like this they dont deserve there licence as a transport company.We are also waiting for two more refunds for tickets that had to be changed but where re-booked on a different day, but no refund has ever emerged for these journeys and its been over a month now. Total they owe in refunds now is £80.00. More needs to be done to make this  company accountable for the refunds they owe customers sort there severe lack of customer services out or more appropriately it should be called customer disservices."
586,Rubbish Customer Service,"Trying to receive refund for change of journey despite speaking to two representatives, completing enquiry on line and completing complaint on line I am still waiting this is alongside the time wasted holding to be put through no wonder always experiencing high volume of calls presumably all complaints !!"
587,still smell of poo,still smell of poo
588,Extremely horrible customer service,"Extremely horrible customer service. Does not value the customer at all. They would rather take the money and lose a customer in the long run. No business ethics at all. Does not listen to nor understand the grievances of the customer. This is a so-called service company that does not understand the fundamental reason for why they are in business in the first place. Repeats over and over again stock phrases as if the customer is not even a person. They are not helpful at all. They only care about protecting themselves with no considerations on why the customer is legitimately frustrated. They take your money without providing a service, unwilling to provide a refund and say they don't care because they have legal support. They said that verbatim over the phone. I recommend staying as far away from them as possible."
589,Appalling. Unacceptable,Appalling. Disgraceful behaviour from staff and your call centre can't even seem to answer a complaint call despite 3 x attempts and waiting over an hour each time. If its complaint avoidance you are going with then its counter productive as its now a bigger complaint!
590,A trip to Siberia would be more enjoyable,"Its getting worse i do the KX to Dundee on a monthly basis and to be trueful Im considering driving rather than putting up with the terrible standard of Virgin trains. When i first started using this service the food was not bad at least it was presentable now you get soggy sandwhich in plastic cardboard packaging and a menu that screams cheap crap. The staff are rude and very unhelpful. My recent journey spent over 5hrs with air-con on so high i could have been in Siberia (a journey i should imagine of better standard than this train service) if you asked the staff to adjust the system not only do they pass the buck their dam right rude. As for the toilets what is that about they stink to high heaven and really need a good clean, someone obviously doesn't know about hygiene standards. But why should virgin care they have the monopoly and one more passengers complaint is not going to make any difference to Richards pockets. At least I've made my thoughts known"
591,Train ride was excellent,"Train ride was excellent, food and service is too which is validity enough to buy the tickets. However the first class lounges are poorly kept. TV doesn’t work amidst a small tournament called theWorld Cup, tables were dirty with cups and litter which made for a poor experience. Very poorly maintained facility which frustrates. Come on Virgin, you’re better than this surely?"
592,Around 5 years ago I bought a train…,Around 5 years ago I bought a train ticket online from Virgin East Coast simply because they operated the route I needed to use to get from A to B.
593,Freezing/Noisy/Yuk,"As I was travelling from Edinburgh to Newcastle, I opted for a first class ticket as a treat."
594,Absolutely appalling Customer Services,Absolutely appalling Customer Services: in particular from the Customer Relations Manager in the MD's office !
595,Me and my sister really enjoyed our…,"Me and my sister really enjoyed our trip on the train. A big thank you to Sam, the young attendant for his excellent services on the way back home From Edinburgh on the 19.36pm."
596,Shame on us..,"I paid £130.00 to stand outside a toilet from Darlington to London.  Apart from the sheer theft, what impression are we giving to our tourists who are sitting on vestibule floors?  It is a shame and an embarrsssment that the nation which invented the train cannot run a rail system"

599,Still waiting for a refund for a…,Still waiting for a refund for a January journey I had to change. I rebooked and paid again on their instructions and applied for a refund for the unused journey. Have been promised refund within 14 working days but that deadline has long since passed.  Customer services have no idea what they are doing and keep contradicting themselves or are they tasked to ease company cashflow rather than help the customer?If only we could pay for our tickets 3 months after travel !
600,have had mainly good service from this…,have had mainly good service from this company.... they do get it wrong occasionally and i've had to claim via the delay-repay route but they do eventually get round to you although it can take a while - sometimes up to 6 months.

603,Amazing,Amazing! Marcus Garvey super helpful and efficient! Thank you so much for dealing with my case so effectively!
604,Consistently mislead their customers…,Consistently mislead their customers with delays and will always look for an excuse as to why they shouldn't pay. Even when it's clearly their fault. Always looking for an excuse to charge extra for no reason and are generally crooks. Guess that's what happens when you have a monopoly on the rails.
605,Train ticket,I had a train ticket to travel from Kings cross
606,I got tickets to  Liverpool from London…,"I got tickets to  Liverpool from London Euston on 29th of February. I supposed to change train at Crewe to continue my journey, however there was a major power cut and the connection train was delayed by 1 hr 30 min. I sent a refund request the same day via the website, I got a replay one month later informing me that  the (tickets I supply were not valid!!) Really??? After many emails which were all ignored I managed to get hold of a customers service advisor from the refund team, I gave my details again, then I was put on hold for 20 min, when finally she returned to the phone she said that I was eligible for refund. Yuppiiiiiii.. But the funny thing's that the refund never came and I'm still waiting!! Hahhahah"
607,I use Virgin Trains about 4-5 times & always enjoy the experience,"I use Virgin Trains about 4-5 times a year on trips to London from Durham and the service & punctuality has always been good,with a choice of seats ,table & ""quiet coach""...Booking early in advance is a must as prices are quite steep otherwise,but with a discount card...Senior..Family ...or 16-25 card you can save 30%"
608,York to Peterborough late again…,York to Peterborough running late again!! Probably miss the connection to Norwich at Peterborough. Making me an hour plus late!
609,A redacted version of the email I've…,A redacted version of the email I've just sent to Transport Focus:
610,Everyone in the Borders hates Virgin,"I have hated Virgin for as long as they have been running the East Coast Mainline. I used to live in Berwick upon Tweed and was basically driven out of the town because the trains are so unreliable and so expensive. For a journey of 45 minutes  from Berwick to Newcastle the open return now costs £29 and at weekends there are never any cheaper advance fares available, so a shopping trip to Newcastle has become prohibitively expensive. I have repeatedly missed appointments because of broken down trains, failed overhead lines, etc. During the recent snow the line north of Newcastle was blocked for days, and while I accept this is the responsibility of Network Rail, what really makes me angry is that Virgin's response to this is to issue a blanket announcement, 'Do not travel'. No attempt to provide details of where exactly the problems are and how to get round them. Every day just, don't travel.  I am delighted that Virgin has abandoned the east coast franchise and would like to see it re-nationalised, but I am so angry about the way they have scammed the taxpayer."
611,"Cancelled train journey, Newcastle to Edinburgh","Train journey Newcastle to Edinburgh with first class ticket. Due to a broken down train on the track, our train never made it to Edinburgh.  After stopping and waiting on the tracks, it was diverted to Dunbar. At Dunbar we were told that the train was turning around and going back to Newcastle."
612,Horrible,"Horrible. Rubbish food, a tiny bowl of macaroni. Rude staff on two occasions, though most were ok KingsX to Inverness 'first class' ticket"
613,Awful website and call handlers,"Awful website,  online and telesales (which is overseas!!?) support."
614,5 out of 5 for Virgin Staff,Train i was booked on lost power. The Virgin Customer Service staff very helpful at Wakefield and Doncaster. Felt very looked after and felt they were genuinely concerned i got home ok. Staff 5 out of 5. Thank you! But took off a star as whenever i catch this train (about 3 times a year) it is always delayed. Maybe it is just bad luck.
615,Awful,"Consistently late, poor connections and no apologies if your travelling to and from  North of Newcastle.  No complaint is ever answered properly even if your a season ticket holder. At best you get a standardised marketing apology. It's expensive,  toilets are dirty. Quite frankly a disgrace."
616,Uncomfortable seats and horrible customer service,"It is almost impossible to reach their customer service. I don't even like to write a comprehensive review here and waste even more time with this. I needed to book two tickets for the same journey, because it is unclear whether I will receive a refund for one of them after having to change the dates of travel. It is impossible to reach them via phone or email and they don't contact me as they promised in their rubbish internet form that I needed to fill out."
617,We had a supposedly first class journey …,"We had a supposedly first class journey with Virgin Trains East Coast last September, from London to Edinburgh then Gleneagles return. The 'first class' service was almost non-existent, no complimentary drinks and horrible sandwich food. The journey back was worse. The train was two hours late, there was no bar and no food offered. The reason I was given was that as it was a Saturday, football fans caused trouble hence the reason the bar was closed! The toilet was dirty and there were no paper towels. I emailed the company to complain and phone customer service (don't do the latter, they are useless and can't understand what you are saying). Having not received a reply I emailed and wrote again. They finally sent me an email which was basically a marketing email extolling the qualities of the company! Still no apology or offer of compensation. At this point in time, four months after the journey, I still await an offer of compensation. Next time I'll fly....."
618,Why is the airline better than the railway?,"Once again travelling first class with virgin and once again, feel completely let down. Broken vestibule door resulting in drafty journey. Broken  reclining chair that won’t  stay in place. Willing staff trying to do everything they can, constrained by ridiculous archaic rules and a complimentary meal that didn’t materialise. First class, it ain’t"
619,Evidently they couldn't care less,It seems most of what I was about to write has already been covered in these reviews. All I will say is that the fact that they have done so little to rectify this dreadful customer review score is a clear example of what any of our opinions means to them.
620,If I could score less than 1 I would,"If I could score less than 1 I would. This company doesn't have a clue about customer service. I complained about their website and the crass language used and received a standard response, not address any of the issues I raised."
621,"Poor response,in fact no response for 2 …","Poor response,in fact no response for 2 months to a delay repay claim. Fares have increased sharply since Virgin took over . Service in first class varies from good to not so good. Overall first class now very expensive for what you get. Quite coaches being removed in first class. Bad idea. Not every one wants to listen to other peoples  mobile phone calls on the train. It is a real pity East Coast trains were refranchised."
622,I would normally give 3 stars overall,"I would normally give 3 stars overall, but have knocked one off because Virgin Customer Service is awful: a complaint I made 16 month ago never received a satisfactory answer and wasn't even acknowledged for 3 months."
623,Last minute cancellations,Poor service. Train to Leeds cancelled just now after everyone told it was preparing for boarding. I now have to wait 45 minutes for another service (it would have been 30 minutes but the next one is already late). Not that staff were outright unhelpful but simply disinterested in the plight of their passengers. This is Virgin east coast personnel on the station. I strongly suspect I will now have to stand half the way to Leeds. This happened to my wife last time she was Kings(makes you very) Cross too.
624,Only use if absolutely desperate,"Only use if absolutely desperate, terrible value for money"
625,"Travel in Style, Excellent Booking Process","forward planned and booked my train travel from the Midlands to London Gatwick airport, very simple online system to use - great benefits of booking direct through VTEC such as free onboard wifi. I also used a comparison site and Virgin Trains were offering the best price. Seat reservations included and you can check how busy the service is. Cant wait to travel!"

630,I even contacted the CEO much …,I even contacted the CEO much obfuscation  over a statutory refund of 140 POUNDS which was due us from 12th April 2016. You end up going to the regulator to sort out your rights. I imagine having to go to law and then eventually find the Sheriffs have to serve them notice at their head office. I was astounded by the amount of bad press on trust pilot from customers until I started using them.

Not everyone is going to the festival. It is obscene, the ticket prices being charged. some people just want to visit family.Tried to use the promotion also, to no avail, they say they will respond in in up to 10 days - what good is that???  It is cheaper and quicker to fly now. By the way the bus advertisements are wrong - city airport is in London!!! very annoyed soon to be ex customer"
633,Poor customer service,"I use virgin east coast regularly, if there is no track disruption they work okay, not particularly comfortable and expensive, in fact a return flight fro Leeds to London is usually less expensive."
634,i have been trying to get hold of …,i have been trying to get hold of someone at virgin trains east coast customer services 05-08-2017 since 8am and it is now 13.05 hrs been constantly phoning for over 5 hrs and still no goddamn person answers the phone this must rate as the most unreliable unhelpful disorganised shambolic services and it is an absolute disgrace all i want ot do is cancel tickets paid for but not collected as cant travel on date on booking due to family bereavement its bad enough this has happened but virgin trains east coast are just a downright bloody disgrace and it is about time their service was totally overhauled namely the useless phone service
635,Poor on board Service,I have recently travelled 1st Class on ECML from Peterborough.
636,An Awful Experience,"It was relatively easy to book our First Class round trip tickets from London King Cross to Edinburgh,"

639,Don't leave property at King's Cross …,"Don't leave property at King's Cross station in the Virgin lounge. Trying to contact anyone about this will involve ever increasing circles of confusion with no one you can talk to or if you finally manage to speak someone at excess baggage the subcontracted company who deals with lost property they will lie to you. (Say they will go and check if the item is in the lounge and promise to ring you back but will never ring you back or answer the phone or answer your voice messages). There is a distinct lack of communication and a system that simply doesn't work and certainly doesn't help the customer. Finally, if you Email Virgin Mandy Walker Customer Solutions Representative will reply quote ""I am really sorry that you found retrieving your property and speaking to the station difficult.However, we take no responsibility for lost property,anything left on board or within our stations"". ""we of course look forward to welcoming you on board in future"". Is this a joke ? Unfortunately, just a symptom of the deteriorating service since Virgin took over the East Coast line."
640,Whenever Virgin trains  announce a new …,"Whenever Virgin trains  announce a new ""improvement"" my heart sinks."
641,Don't bother with first class,Don't bother with first class. This used to be an excellent service but is now a shambles. 40 minutes for a coffee to arrive. No breakfast offered on midweek train. Astoundingly brusque staff. Maybe if there were more staff I might not be starving my butt off writing this. £100+ for a ticket is a joke. Do not travel first class it is an omni shambles
642,Impossible to get hold of Virgin Trains East Coast Lost Property,"I don't know if anyone has had as much difficulty as I have getting hold of Virgin East Coast Lost Property. I lost a bag over a month ago and after having filled in the online lost property form three times, two complaints and countless phone calls with no answer to all of the relevant lost property numbers I must draw the conclusion that they don't have anyone who works in lost property. I strongly suggest you never forget a bag on a Virgin East Coast train, you'll probably never see it again."
643,"Usually bad, but even worse this time.","Virgin East Coast are well known for being useless. I have taken to travelling and couple of hours before any major meetings as I have been delayed so many times. But this week was even worse. I was told my ticket was invalid on the London to York service I was on - even though I had been told otherwise - and the 'revenue protection officer' tried to make me pay an extra £129. After the unhelpful guard had told me which train my ticket was valid on (including that same train after Peterborough - but I couldn't stay on it as I hadn't joined it there?!) I was told by the guard on the next train that my ticket wasn't valid on that service either! Anyway, I eventually got home much later than planned, and it had to involve a £30 taxi ride home as I missed the last train. Awful treatment by Virgin. I had been representing the UK in Brussels and chose to get the train. Next time I'll fly."
644,Almost perfect!,I pre-booked many weeks ago to go to London with my wife for our wedding anniversary. I contacted Virgin about this and asked if they could do a tannoy announcement.
645,Outrageous,"Booked a trip from London - Edinburgh for my 70 year old parents who had flown in from Australia the day before, me and my husband, and our 2 kids under 10. Had visions of a nice relaxing trip where people could snooze, enjoy the countryside and have a cup of tea on the way."
646,Really disappointed,"Really disappointed, travelled from London to Durham first class. There was no hot food available due to staff shortages, so there were just soggy wraps available. The coach was noisy and really hot. There were cold drinks which were warm and no ice (as it had melted) may as well have travelled standard class and bought a sandwich from a vending machine."
647,Awful experience!,"I have recently travelled by Virgin east coast train to Edinburgh. I had the ticket for 7pm, however, I am not able to get on the train as it was overcrowded, so it was not possible to stand even. Me and my friend were advised to take the next train at 7.30pm, so we headed back to the gates. However, I have spotted that one of the 1st class carriages was not completely full, so we have asked whether we could possibly get on the train in that carriage, so he confirmed and let us in. Luckily, we managed to find 2 seats, which seemed reserved, but none actually came in during the whole journey. As we had standard ticket, the ticket inspector asked us to upgrade to 1st class which was £120 per person, so we did not have any options, but to pay. We were told that they might have run out of meals so had the remind them at least 5 times to check whether there was any food left. At the end, we got our meal, however, we were not given a desert with the excuse that the train was full and they can not pass through, and all of their staff looked angry and acted impolitely. Overall, terrible experience."
648,First class poor standards of customer …,"First class poor standards of customer care, they just don't get it."
649,Boarded the train this morning from …,"Boarded the train this morning from York to London. - 2 adults, a 2 year old and an 8 year old. We spent about half an hour struggling up and down the train with kids and luggage looking for seats. Created a stressful situation for the whole family. A very dissapointing experience. Avoid unless you have allocated seat numbers. This option wasn't available on our outbound journey. Staff available on the bar and trolley but not to help a family find seats. Profit over customer service."
650,Payment but NO TICKET,"I booked a ticket on my company credit card which, according to the website, was accepted. Then the tickets didn't arrive so I phoned the ""customer helpline"" only to be told, after 2 hours of waiting, that the payment was not accepted and therefore I would have to book again. I was told quite categorically that the problem was with my card!"
651,Unacceptable lack of Customer Service,"I had a train service cancelled by Virgin last year which meant I couldn't travel, so they provided me with a replacement ticket to be used another time. This was dated so could be used at any time on any service one year from the issue date. Unfortunately I needed to book a seat as I didn't want to stand from Peterborough to Edinburgh."
652,I had to take an earlier train (0.5 hr) …,"I had to take an earlier train (0.5 hr) from Leeds to London and conductor handed me an unpaid fare notice for 91 GBP. I did not pay and wanted to appeal against this  on the customer telephone line, but nobody replies. What a horrible customer Service!! I also emailed them with no reply."
653,Strip them of the franchise.,"After a month, I was informed by Virgin I was due a refund on a ticket for a train that broke down. I was also advised that I should call a particular number to claim my refund. After 1 hour ten minutes of holding I had to give up. I have subsequently called another number to complain about their service and have so far been held for 50 minutes. Diabolical Service! I hope you read this Mr Branson. Your service is crap."
654,Terrible service. Customer phone line is woeful,"I booked a ticket on the website and requested a refund on the my account section on the same day before the payment was taken. They charged me anyway and didn't reply to my request for a refund, nor is there any information on the website with a status update. So I decided to get a reply I'd have to call them, and I could write an essay on why this is the worst customer phone lines I've ever used. The 'web support' team in Edinburgh don't answer their phone ever it seems. So I call back to the sales team who surprise surprise answered quite quickly. They recommended I call the customer complaints number instead, so I tried that and I've now been on the phone for 30 minutes with no sign of an answer. This company is a disgrace and should never have taken the franchise off East Coast who were state run. If there's ever been a better example of why privatisation of the rail network was a terrible idea this is it. Where is the customer service, the supposedly 'innovative' private sector? You can't even answer a phone to a customer with a legitimate complaint. I'll be trying every other option in future rather than get on one of virgins trains. Richard Branson and the whole company should be ashamed of themselves. You're not doing the bare minimum to keep a franchise, you're doing less and I hope for the public's sake you lose it very soon."
655,Shame you can't give it no stars,"Shame you can't give it no stars.  Dreadful company.  Having had an unsatisfactory response to a complaint, I wrote (proper hard copy letter) to the customer services rep on September 6th to explain my dissatisfaction and request a further response. As of 30th September I have not had the courtesy of an acknowledgement let alone a substantive reply.  Whether it is through renationalisation or a new franchisee, the sooner these people are removed from our railway system the better."
656,horrible service and staff - avoid!,"Horrible experience. Firstly, their app is not working properly (1,7 stars out of 5 in Google Play). I purchased my ticket online and it was supposed to load in the app's wallet. Unfortunately, it didn't and therefore i had to go to the ticket desk in King's Cross and ask them to help me. A helpful lady tried to call internally but no one was there to answer the call and advice on what to do! As the train was leaving shortly, she decided to give me a handwritten piece of paper (with an official stamp) stating that i have paid for the ticket. I had the booking confirmation with the date, price and an email saying my card was charged. All evidence was there. Yet, the ticket inspector was extremely rude. In front of the passengers he humiliated me. I have never felt so awful in my life, it made me feel like i was a thief. I had paid 134 pounds for a one way ticket to Edinburgh from London (!!) but he didn't care at all if the app malfunctioned or if i had paid my ticket."
657,For 2nd time in a month I have been on …,"For 2nd time in a month I have been on a failed train. Right now I have been stranded on a hot train, no aircon near Peterborough for over 3 hrs. The device that feeds electricity from the overheads completely failed in a series of bangs and flashes, causing the train to grind to a halt."
658,Arrogant staff and awful train service.,"No platform for train displayed on Kings Cross notice board and only caught the train because we overheard someone saying the platform number. All the Virgin staff at Kings Cross said was to wait for the platform number to be displayed. If we had done that, we would still be waiting for it. Useless, unhelpful and ignorant staff who are supposed to be working for a flagship company who's boss lives the life or riley in the Carribean and doesn't give a flying fig about you or me."
659,general experience,Staff are generally slack and rude and no customer service at all.
660,small-print robbery,"Had an advance ticket (£36) from Newcastle to London, unfortunately missed it and took next one departing at 20:06."
661,Virgin Trains East Coast - Excellent Service!,"I regularly travel from Edinburgh to London Kings' Cross. The service is excellent, the prices reasonable, and the train experience is thoroughly enjoyable - without exception. A flawless service - keep it up guys!"
662,Virgin failure ti deal with complaint,I had a problem with a journey on the 14th May On Southern Rail.
663,I used to work in Web usability ...,"I used to work in Web usability - and it seems that VTEC has either designed their site with no user feedback or test panels, or they've designed it to make it very tricky to find the cheapest ticket. (If you select the ""Cheapest Ticket"" option, you still might miss cheaper options that are 'buried' under the ""More"" button.)"
664,Advance saver fares on Virgin Trains East Coast,"I went on the Virgin Trains East Coast website today, in order to book a trip to Edinburgh in November."
665,Excellent trip to York with them,"Excellent trip to York with them. Comfy, clean trains. Advanced fares were pretty good too. Slight gripe is the cost of items in the buffet car."
666,appalling new website,"appalling new website. crashes, loses past bookings. its one of the worst relaunches i have ever seen. lost loads of features and is confusing. phoning through to customer services waste of time. their staff are as fed up as customers. if i didn't have to use them i would never travel with them again. monopoly means i have nio choice. how they keep the franchise is beyond ridiculous."
667,Subsidy Hoover,Had to wait 4 hours because i had a super off peak and finished work early asked to 'upgrade' it to an off peak and was told it would cost another £80! When i got on the train originally booked it was so full I couldn't sit on the floor -- so how is it off peak?
668,2 complaints in a matter of weeks!,"Complaint #1) Arrived 20 mins before train. Staff member #1 refused to print my ticket as my credit card had been stolen that week (despite multiple other ID proving my identity and having been able to withdraw multiple tickets previously without original payment card). Staff member #2 agreed, but only once my train had departed, and said I could only travel after paying £100 excess, despite situation not being my fault."
669,Wow probably the worst customer service …,"Wow probably the worst customer service from anybody. No reply to emails sent, have even emailed the CEO and he doesn't reply! How do they keep the franchise ?"
670,All PR no service,"As soon as Virgin took over ticket prices for my normal route rose from £50 to £150 - a whopping increase, making the journey unaffordable for me.   They spend vast sums of money on stupid irritating adverts plastered all over the place, rather than providing a decent affordable service.   Not everyone can book 6 months in advance (even though the price of advance tickets has even risen considerably since 2015) and many if not most have to travel last minute.  Its outrageous that you can end up paying 200-300% more than someone else for the same journey.  Everyone should have access to reasonably priced tickets at all times like everywhere else in Europe.  Virgin and the whole rail system in the UK is a disgrace."
671,Very lengthy and slow customer service …,Very lengthy and slow customer service to get a refund for a delayed train - 3 months of correspondence and reminders.
672,First class passengers on Doncaster …,"First class passengers on Doncaster station waiting for the Edinburgh train. Time for a coffee.....hang on, where's the lounge?"
673,BEWARE VIRGIN EAST COAST,"To begin. I had bought tickets via the Train Line booking service to travel to Edinburgh from London Kings Cross. Normally I'm usually on the ball with these things and printed out my tickets at home. Day of departure and arrive in plenty of time to have a coffee. Sitting in the station concourse it suddenly occurred that my print outs were not the actual tickets needed to travel. In a panic I headed for the booking office where I was informed that I had to contact The Train Line. At this point I had about 15 minutes to departure. The booking assistant gave me a number to call and advised that I should get them to fax details over to them at Kings Cross. After a very tense time listening to the usual recorded options that pass for exceptional customer service, I managed to get them to fax over my booking. Remember I did have a print out proving my reservation and seat. Rushing back to the counter the man I saw couldn't have cared less."
674,Never  had such bad customer service …,Never  had such bad customer service delivered! Resolve don't blame!  Horrible company. Very rude call centre staff.
675,Currently travelling to Edinburgh,"Currently travelling to Edinburgh. 1st class lounge coffee machine out of order. No toast offered. Breakfast food quality very low and degrading over previous visits, almost inedible. Sausage not cooked, pink meat/ raw pork. One cup of coffee offered in 1.5 hours. Staff focussed on clean-up vs service"
676,Terrible journey followed by refusal of refund despite 1hr delay,I was subject to a terrible journey where the train was obscenely busy we were unable to access seats and had to stand for the entire 3 hour journey on the delayed York to London route. They then refused to refund my ticket cost and then failed to reply to subsequent enquiry.
677,Fantastic Scotland service Edinburgh to Inverness.,16/02/2017 travelled with Virgin Train from Edinburgh to Inverness via Pitlochry. The updated Virgin trains are so comfortable and the service from the staff was excellent. We travelled first class at a very reasonable fare and was happily surprised with the comfort and service. If you compare the Virgin service to the Scotrail service on the same line then Virgin trains sits head and shoulders above Scotrail both in comfort and Service. I am not normally a fan of train travel in the UK but this experience has changed my opinion. Normally we would hire a car for the journey but on this occasion the train turned out to be amazing. If you are flexible when you travel you can get great deals. I highly recommend using the Virgin east coast train service and we will definitely be using again. So relaxing not having to drive and have an enjoyable meal and plenty of free drinks on the way. Well done Virgin you have converted a non-train user.
678,Poor customer service and misleading offers,"We have booked to travel to Durham on Monday using Virgin East Coast trains. Today I received an email offering us the chance to upgrade to First Class for £20 each. We decided to do so, as it seemed like a relatively reasonable price to make the journey a possible treat. However I then noticed that this ""offer"" could not be used in conjunction with our Senior railcards. This restriction seemed so illogical and downright mean minded that I rang Virgin's customer services to check if it was correct. The first time I worked my way through the irritating phone menus to what I thought was the right option I was subjected to loud music for several minutes and then the line went dead. The second time I tried a different route through the menus and did speak to a customer assistant, in what seemed to be a non UK call centre, which I do not object to on any grounds other than it seems to be ridiculous to be discussing a trip to Durham with someone who is probably on the Indian sub continent. Anyway, he confirmed that we could not upgrade to First Class if we had used our railcards when booking but said that this was the general rule and that he could give me another number to try to see if perhaps there could be an exception, or so the implication was. I waited for several minutes for him to return to give me this number (the matter of seconds surely) again listening to unpleasant loud music, and then put the phone down myself in frustration."
679,Not worth the money,"Very disappointed in the journey (Edinburgh to London) as a whole. We upgraded to a first class, Quiet car (at an expense of 150 GBP) which was a waste of money. There were several families with loud children on the car and no effort whatsoever by the Train Guard to ask them to be a little more respectful of the other passengers. Wish we had saved our money and just stayed in our regular coach since we weren't able to relax anyway."
680,Great service,"Had a day-trip to London from Newcastle with our four year old son. To make the most of the day we booked the 7pm train back from King's Cross, with a table as travelling with children can be fun and trying in equal measures."
681,Thieves,If you buy a ticket and choose to get an e-ticket you are no longer able to change the time/date of your train or get a refund. Even if you pay the admin fee. They hide this in their T&Cs. This wouldn't be acceptable in any other industry so don't know how they get away with this.
682,Delay reppay delay... when does it become negligence?,What is the point of bigging up delay repay on the train when they are seemingly unable to get it done.
683,1st Class!!!- Stood full trip in corridor outside toilet!!,"Paid over £400 for 3 1st class tickets from Peterbourgh to KIngs Cross yesterday.  We were forced to stand in standard class in a corridor next to the toilet, 1st class, I don't think so."
684,Great Service. Good food,I travelled from Edinburgh to Aberdeen departing 1428 today.
685,Serious issue with the Virgin East Coast Website,"Purchased tickets on 11th May for use on 29th May. 1 week before travel still no receipt or itinerary information even though the funds had left the account. Called Virgin and they told me no order exists, they also claim that no account exists against my email. I'm very sure the email was entered correctly but even still they must have other means of searching?"
686,Poor Customer Service and Raised Prices,"As other reviews have said, the change from East Coast to Virgin has not been a good one.  The staff on the Inverness - Edinburgh line continue to be excellent but Virgin has raised prices, done away with the rewards scheme and ignores emails.  I am trying to get the Delay Repay compensation but, after numerous emails with no reply, I doubt that I will get it.  Why offer this scheme if you are not willing to honour it?"
687,Stick to Planes Forget Trains!,My teenage daughter in early December went to Newcastle via York from Scarborough for an One Day as a potential new student for Newcastle University in the academic year starting September 2016. A simple journey made a nightmare by Network Rail and 3rd party train company breaking down at an intersection of the main East Coast line outside Darlington.
688,The 'Great' Virgin Headless Chicken Act!!,"I must be honest, that the levels of Customer Service (if that's what you laughingly call it) during the chaos of the evening of 5 December, 2015 @ approximately 18:00 at Waverley Station Edinburgh, were the absolute worst that I've ever encounted and showed me that during an emergency, Virgin Rail has no back up plan or protocols to handle extreme situations. My daughter was booked into 1st Class on the 18:41 from Edinburgh to Newcastle. I appreciate the weather was extreme and the situation rapidly spiraled out of control. We checked your website for updates as we were well aware of flooding etc in the Borders & Northumberland. Your Website indicated a detour via Carlisle which although was reassuring we thought a bit odd, due to flooding in Cumbria?! We stood with hundreds of other anxious passengers on the main Waverley concourse tracking the 18:41 train as it moved towards its departure time. All it showed was 'On Time' but no platform? As the minutes ticked by and arrival time ticked on, we realized with no updates or reliable information the 18:41 was either cancelled or going no where fast, for obvious reasons. Trying to make sense of PA announcements in that crowd was impossible. We could only see 'Scotrail'Staff reassuring their passengers but where were Virgin Staff, conspicuous by their absence?! The Waverley Information counter was 80 + persons deep. Your website was not updating, I tried Twitter and received supercilious, snarky Tweets from yourselves which did nothing to reassure us. Eventually a woman in a Virgin windbreaker casually informed us that Buses / Coaches were waiting on the Market Street side of Waverley, this triggered a mad scramble up escalators & stairs: (the elderly, infirm & blind took their chances) and as we arrived at the Market Street exit, a bemused BR Policeman informed us there were no Buses / Coaches! Still no Virgin staff to advise or re-assure. Another mad scramble back to the Virgin Ticket Office which was bursting to the rafters. 2 maybe 3 staff trying to advise us, your Passengers. Again no announcements, no staff coming out to speak etc. Hundreds in the queue.  By 19:12:40 (can supply a photo) the 18:41 train was still on the Board as 'Delayed' No it wasn't, it was 'Cancelled' but still no word from Virgin, just hundreds of your passengers trying to glean information and separate the rumors from fact. It became apparent that the single man (can supply a photo) in your Virgin Ticket Office, who despite over whelming odds, was dolling out Taxi Vouchers, to get folk home to Newcastle. Eventually I got my daughter into a party of 4 other ladies all bound for Newcastle, eventually leaving on a highly hazardous road journey to Newcastle Central. I repeat - I fully understand that the weather played havoc with Train departures. I fully appreciate it had been raining for 2 days none stop. I do not appreciate the lack of reliable, reassuring information from Virgin Rail. You have glossy, glitzy and funky PR and TV ads, but when the wet & brown smelly stuff hits the fan, your staff, such as those I could see, had not a clue how to deal with agitated & anxious passengers stranded in Waverley. Shame on you Virgin Rail! Your planning & protocols are abysmal!"
689,Extreme Irritation at VTEC,"On the 21st September 2015, I travelled on VIrgin Train East Coast to Edinburgh. Due to a damaged rail tracks, our train was delayed for over two hours."
690,Always a poor experience dont know if…,Always a poor experience dont know if gets worse or just worse
691,great if you find the right medium (or person),"We tried the chat and phone ""help"" and got a similar response to some of the negative reviews."
692,Useless insurance,"Useless insurance. It is not what it seems to be. Received an email saying Relax your covered while in reality they cover very limited cases. Check their WORDING. Absolutely useless all the credit cards have an insurance like this included, no body need this. Customer care rude and unhelpful."
693,They still haven't learned what good service is,Hello
694,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. I understand they sometimes have to cancel trains due to matters out of their control, but the way they deal with it is unacceptable.  Replacement journeys are at non comparable times, effectively cutting a day off the time away."
695,Website bookings,"So, tried to take advantage of a 15% discount offer on an Interrail ticket which the offer was due to run out on Saturday 31st March. Obviously you need to know you can get under ""the channel"" before setting a date for your interrail ticket to start. So I tried and tried numerous times (and I really mean numerous) to book and pay for a ticket on the Saturday evening with no success as it always came up with an error message. So tried and tried again the following morning again with no success, so eventually had to give in and had to phone up to place my order for my tickets.......""yes sir we've been having problems with our website, but that'll still cost you £10 for booking over the phone!!!!!!"""
696,Started off badly got worse and the…,Started off badly got worse and the less said about the end the better. To be fair the staff at ebbs fleet were OK but I will be home over 2 hours late because 1 eurostar are an hour late and 2 because they are not stopping where we were contracted to go. 50 quid also spent on a peak ticket to ebbs fleet for me and the eldest this morning.poor is being generous.  They have become awful why? They used to be good
697,Terrible service and no consideration…,"Terrible service and no consideration for customers. I was due to travel over the weekend but unfortunately spent Friday in hospital and now have limited mobility meaning I couldn't travel. The advertised claim of 'change time/ date of tickets for just £30' is misleading, it actually cost me £164 to change tickets for me and my friend. Customer service were no help after I was direct to them via the online chat service (who assured me they could help) and said as it's my fault I couldn't travel not theirs it was right that I should pay. Should I have realised changing tickets would have cost as much as two new tickets I would have flown instead. Deeply regret using this company and will definitely not make the same mistake again"
698,"Horrible customer service, theifs in disguise.","I waited on hold for at least an hour. I booked my train and saw there was a mistake. It must of been an hour since I ordered it. I saw it was a one way and I just wanted it to be round trip. I didn’t want my money back, I was just going to change it to round trip. They told me no, that there was nothing they can do. I asked to speak to a manager and their actual response was “the manager isn’t going to waster her time telling you the same thing I did. Sorry nothing we can do” what a complete joke of customer service and I can’t believe they want to rip people off their hard earned money. Now I have to buy another ticket back to London. My London to Paris ticket was 290 US dollars and Paris to London is 186 US dollars. The round trip would of been 340 US dollars total.  They have no intent of making their customers happy. Horrible company."
699,Rip off,Absolute rip off. They will go the same way as Monarch for taking advantage of customers.
700,Shambles,Shambles... poor organisation... shambolic check in...
701,RUBBISH SERVICE,"One star from me and that's only because I can't put none. My daughter and her boyfriend are currently stuck in Brussels because Eurostar will not let them change their train time unless they pay 260 euros on top of what they already have paid. No leeway for a difficult personal circumstance. They have nowhere to go, no money and her boyfriend has been unwell. DO NOT USE THIS TERRIBLE COMPANY."
702,Regular traveler,I am a regular traveler on the eurostar (once a month) and their service is pricey and terrible. Unfortunately there is no other choice.
703,Horrible After - sales services and Customer - Care Services,It seems as if they just do not want to refund your money and once a process of refund is initiated u would expect it to be taken care of and receive your money in stipulated time. But do not be fooled by what they claim on their website. I have had to call them 3 times and they every time I have called them in intervals of a week I was told that they do not know why it's not processed and they will have to initiate it again. It seems as if they want to delay this process on purpose or they do not want to pay you back your own money altogether. I cant trust the words written on their website or the words spoken by the customer services team over the phone.
704,EuroNOstars!,"What a complete debacle Eurostar's ""Customer service"" has proven to be. We were left stranded outside of Brussels - for nearly 3 hours, despite the fact we were only 10km away from the station. There was no information, no explanation and no standard of care. The poor ground staff were given no advice and guidance from their company and the train was full of distressed children and elderly people - including a disabled person who was reportedly having difficulties as the air was getting more and more muggy. Conflicting information was eventually fed back to us - including complete lies from the Eurostar twitter team. No compensation has been offered - no apology was made. When I eventually looked through the website myself the computer informed me I would be entitled to £14.50.......it is insulting. We lost hours of our holiday, missed connecting trains on the way back with another delay. Then were told that we could have an E-Voucher?! No thank you - I have no desire to travel on your service again. We were dumped on the old trains each time - there was no protocol with how to deal with the distressed passengers. No meal or sustenance was provided. Only one poor guard dealing with the train as all other Eurostar attendants hid from the clearly confusing situation. Then to have a condescending and unhelpful customer service politely tell me all the ways they will rip me off as a consumer. My train on route home was also delayed meaning that we would miss another connection - it was just over an hour late - but Eurostar are trying to argue it was 55 minutes late. Yet again - shoddy customer service and communication."
705,I'm pretty disillusioned with Eurostar,"I'm pretty disillusioned with Eurostar. I've been to Brussels and Paris, both returns in the last few weeks. Three out of the four trains were late, two very late. One was two hours late and they offer a measly £7.50 refund. At no point has the wifi worked enough to even realistically do emails. The food in the on board cafe is horrible. I had a ""chicken caesar"" wrap on the way back from Paris which was really soggy, no flavour, just chicken, lettuce and soggy wrap. And it said ""use by"" the following day - to think what it would have been like after another day!"
706,İf Eurostar cancel your trip because of…,"İf Eurostar cancel your trip because of weather conditions and you didn't print your tickets before they cancelled from Amsterdam to London and there is  no options for printing your ticket including Thalys ticket, but when you call Eurostar customer service, they say we canceled only Brussel to London and you can still get Thalys train but if they cancel your trip you cant access your Thalys ticket anymore on the Eurostar website and Eurostar's website say call customer service, customer service say go to Amsterdam Central station and pickup your Thalys ticket but there is no option to collect ticket because it dosent show on the system. Because they cancel your booking number and Thalys ticket under the this booking number because you booked through Eurostar web site. No one could get access to my Thalys ticket and print at Amsterdam station because of cancelled booking number. During a total of 90 minutes of calling time over 3 times with customers service they told me , i had to buy another ticket with Thalys get to Brussels. Why should I have to pay for another ticket when Eurostar canceled my Thalys ticket. Guys when you buy ticket from Eurostar you have to print immediately otherwise if they cancel and you didn't print your ticket before you can't access your Thalys ticket for print or download."
707,I had a wonderful ride on a modern…,"I had a wonderful ride on a modern train to London.  So why two stars?  It was not the train I booked, and I had booked to go to Ashford.  The queues at Paris Gare du Nord were horrific.  My connecting train was delayed but I arrived at Gare du Nord with a good half an hour to check-in.  The queue to check-in took over 40 minutes.  And then had to wait another 40 minutes to find out with 5 minutes to go that I had been reassigned a seat in the next, modern train to London.  Something needs to be done about the Paris check-in.  It was also very poorly sign-posted.  But that new train was really comfortable."
708,"Delays, more delays and no wifi for standard","It is winter time and it seems impossible for Eurostar to have my train leaving on time. This is the second Friday in 2 weeks where I will be 30 minutes delayed (but no compensation, while it represents a 25% time increase of the journey). My husband travelling last WE had no more luck."
709,Very poor Eurostar experience!,Recent Eurostar experience has been a complete joke. Left London on a Friday morning train which was over 90 minutes late. Missed the meeting in Paris I was scheduled to go to. The departure area at st pancras was complete chaos and they stopped letting people through to prevent over crowding.
710,Terrible service,Terrible service
711,Overcrowded shoddy service,"A very poor service on the Chester to Manchester train, overcrowded to an unacceptable level at peak times. Frequent occasions when the train has an inadequate number of carriages for the passengers, some of whom get left behind when no more can be crammed aboard, only to have to wait an hour for the next train. Frequent delays on getting into Manchester."

717,Amazing service today.,Amazing service today.. my mother was on the train this afternoon in Pontypridd and left her bag on the station when I got on the 17:45 2A48 from Cardiff to aberdare this evening and spoke to a lovely guard called Craig and explained what had happened. He then advised me to contact the Newport branch which didn't turn out to be helpful so he took it upon himself to search for my mother's bag which he then found and got back to us with everything still in the handbag. My mother is eternally grateful and we can't thank the guard enough for his kind work today thank you .
718,Horrible service..,Horrible service... Extremely rude staff!
719,"Thank you Ian Thomas, Arriva Holyhead","Just want to say a huge Thank You to Ian Thomas of Arriva Trains, Holyhead, Wales. I lost my Interrail ticket while changing trains and he went to great lengths to get it back for me - he first rang around all the trains and stations it could have been at and then when it was luckily found, he organized to have it brought to Holyhead for me a couple of hours later so I was able to seamlessly continue on my journey to Dublin. Amazing customer service!"
720,"Always delayed, overcrowded and expensive","Trains are always overcrowded, and are delayed or cancelled more often than not. Fares are extortionate."
721,Pathetic excuse of a company.,"Total joke and company employs a bunch of rude and useless people. Was late last night when I was trying to catch the train from Chester to Wrexham, the guard said ""first two carriages to Wrexham"" and Lord behold where did I end up..... In Shotton... Thank you Arriva Trains Wales for leaving me stranded. If it weren't for my sister who drove all the way to Shotton to get me I would have had a very long and cold night sleeping outside... Why do you employ a bunch of turds? A banana could have done a better job. Sort yourselfs out. I cannot write into words how angry I am.. The guard needs throwing under one of your dirty trains. Your absolutely useless and good for nothing. Bunch of bellends."
722,This train company is the worst,"This train company is the worst, the trains always run late never on time! Then cancel trains with no explanation. Also to add  insult to injury. The price of train tickets are a joke for the service they  provide! Don’t ride on Arriva Trains Wales"
723,Absolutely diabolical company,"Absolutely diabolical company, continuing to charge high prices for a second rate service. Practically every one of the services they run that I've been on in the North West has been filled to the brink and there appears to be little being done to address this issue, aside from excuses over an inability to hire more coaches. Baffling that they've been able to hold onto the contract for so long, amazed that there hasn't been an intervention from a governing body."
724,A useless company,I can't remember the last time I got an arriva train that run on time and wasn't totally rammed.
725,Pointless in booking seats,"Early mornings or rush hours tend to be the most packed as many people are commuting to their daily activities. Most of the time, the trains are short in carriages making the morning travels even more packed. Booking a seat is pointless when you cannot even get to your seat. How can I get to my seat when I have a train to catch to catch this train? By the time I arrive many people have already come on board"
726,Top quality service today on the 09.35 …,"Top quality service today on the 09.35 service from Newport to Holyhead. Despite a need to swap trains at Chester, the guard acted in a particularly friendly,  professional and helpful manner at all times. He deserves recognition for his quality service."
727,I travel on this service everyday - but this was a step too far.,"I was about to board the 16:25 from Birmingham New street to Shrewsbury, my daily commute on 30/01/2018. As usual the train was disgustingly overfilled (a complaint for a separate occasion). Most carriages were filled right up to the doors. I noticed the final carriage had a fair amount of space by the rear doors as well as down the isle. Aware of this I was about to board (in a rush as there was only a minute left before the train departed) where a rather tall male conductor blocked my path and explained rather rudely that I could not board this section of the train as it was 'full' now I'm no expert in the physics of space in trains but compared to the other carriages this area was by far the emptiest, with there being enough space easily for another 15 people, I explained this to the conductor. But he was having none of it. Concerned by the lack of time i now had due to this rude arrogant man I had no choice now but to run off to somehow find another area with space for me to board. In my frustration of this incident, as I was walking off I shouted 'useless' to which the train manager I had just had my encounter with started screaming 'excuse me' .... 'EXCUSE ME' in my direction. I continued to run to another carriage where I could board, ignoring this man as I was concerned I would not get on the train and I didn't have time to deal with him again. At this point as I was midway between the end carriage he started to run after me. To which I then stopped in shear shock of this action. He then got within"
728,Arrival trains Wales is a load of garbage!,"You have put the cost of train tickets up and yet you still can't be on time and gave made me late every week, sort ya act out and stop taking the Michael!"
729,Arriva lata trains,"Always late, if your lucky and not cancelled. Overpriced. Overcrowded. Filthy trains."
730,Very poor service,"Cancel trains with no explanation, always late, always overcrowded, no logic to the number of carriages allocated to services. A busy service will have 2 carriages while a quiet one has 5 almost empty carriages. Bizarre, considering the numbers don't tally between morning and evening trains. Do cross country trains think a smaller number of commuters return home? Well, the clue is in the word 'commuter'..."
731,Travelling from Glasgow to Newcastle…what a waste of money,Travelling from Glasgow to Newcastle “First Class”.......
732,Terrible service and customer service,"Terrible service and customer service . our train was canceled , we were not informed so we had to wait , so we arrived at Birmingham late and missed our connecting train to wales and had to wait 2 hours . myself with 2 children , and no seats as our seats we had preboooked were canceled , very disappointing .so our 5 hour train journey was 7 1/2 hours"
733,currently travelling on one of cross…,currently travelling on one of cross country's new trains now I understand why people hate them so uncomfortable no back suort tiny little dro down table cramped and over crowded so like myself no other option but to travel no food on board either would love to meet the idiots that thought these were an upgrade obviously they have never used them only gave a 1* because nothing lower of course cross-country  directors won't care as they will be chauffeured disgusting vile down market service should be ashamed to offer such a dreadful service!!!!!!!!
734,Don’t waste your money.  Cross Country 1st Class is a Farce 😡,"Don’t bother booking 1st Class with this company.  I was travelling from York to Birmingham New Street and boarded at 12.45pm for a two and a half hour journey.  I’m 71 and was travelling with my 7 year old grandson.  We hadn’t bought anything to eat as complimentary refreshments are normally part of the deal, even if it’s just a sandwich.  I normally travel with Virgin and the service is reliable."
735,Don't bother paying for First Class as…,"Don't bother paying for First Class as the service is appalling, half-hearted and a waste of money."
736,I have have asked twice for a refund…,I have have asked twice for a refund through the online refund form due to a delayed train and still not heard anything after a month. Not even a reference number.
737,"Rude and abrupt Train conductor"" Ryan""…","Rude and abrupt Train conductor"" Ryan"" this morning on the 10.17am Stanstead Express from Peterborough to Stanstead Airport."
738,This company is my daily trip to the…,This company is my daily trip to the office. The trains are overcrowded and filthy. The tickets are over priced and an insult. The cattle  get more room than we do.I am told the railways prefer to ship freight as it doesnot involve somebody moaning  and they get way more money for doing it. Then for the trains to run on time...we need a miracle .....
739,Had a fire on engine in 1st class…,"Had a fire on engine in 1st class carriage tonight (April 4, 2018) when travelling from Yorkshire to Southampton. All staff rushed customers to move to another carriage after fire alarm. I travel with a baby, pushchair and some bags, including shopping bag with some groceries. They asked everyone to board off in Burton, brought my pushchair, pushchair’s basket and one of the bags to the entrance of the next carriage but... not the grocery bag. Is CC staff hungry?"
740,Terrible service,"We went to Bristol Temple Meads today to get our scheduled bus replacement to Bristol Parkway to catch a train to Yorkshire. Our bus was late picking us up and late arriving at Parkway. We hurried to the platform only to be told the train doors were shut and we couldn't get on. We watched as our booked train left, and had to wait an hour for the next one, not knowing if we would even get s seat. What part of ""replacement""  does Cross Country not understand? Why couldn't the train wait for the scheduled bus? Terrible service."
741,I'm Cross with Cross Country,"Terrible experience, over priced tickets, lazy staff, have to pay for wifi, even scotrail has free wifi. Yes! Scotrail the s*it stain of Scotland has free wifi, but Cross Country doesn't. Dont ever ride with them, worst train ride of my life and ive been on the Beijing and Tokyo Subways"
742,Worst customer service!,I have been a regular customer and using crosscountry website for purchasing tickets over an year. For the first time when i needed to change one of my tickets i had to purchase another as they promised to refund the money in 5 working days. After 3 weeks when there wasn't any sign of refund i contacted them and was told i need to send the ticket back to get the refund ( was not mentioned at all to begin with) again in 5 working days. I sent the ticket  (luckily) by recorded delivery. After 2 weeks again no sign of refund. Upon contact they denied to receive any ticket but when i chased up the recorded delivery reference they admitted they had recieved it the next day i sent the ticket. Again promised will get my refund next day but it has been 3 days and still no sign at all!!
743,Horrendous Service,"I booked a seat on a train, time came to board and it was rammed fuller than a cattle cart, I was unable to get my reserved seat and had to sit on the floor outside a stinking toilet."
744,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service. Train cancelled so I’ve emailed for a refund and have been chasing them for over one month for a reply to end this matter, I am just getting ignored!"
745,"Avoid, avoid and avoid!","I had booked a train ticket from Scunthorpe to Birmingham international. It was almost double the price to book from Doncaster to Birmingham international so I booked this instead as it was the same train (which just shows how they manipulate prices from busier destinations). This train was cancelled on very little notice, maybe 5-10 minutes at the most. I was forced to book a taxi to reach the airport in time for my flight. I then sent an email to there team which took well over 2 weeks to get a response. I was told I was not eligible to claim any expenses on the taxi I had to pay for and also I had to post my ticket back for the train that never even departed to get my money back. I told them why do I need to do this, clearly their system should automatically credit customers their money back for cancelled journeys, instead of wasting their time in the hope they will not send the ticket back. Will defiantly avoid them in the future."
746,These trains absolutely STINK,These trains absolutely STINK! It’s disgusting!
747,Terrible.,The only train service I have known to still charge for the WiFi.
748,Shockingly bad,"Truly appalling service.  Bought a ticket for my partially sighted father on the understanding that he would only have to change trains once during his journey; a change that we clued him up for and he was happy about.  The price of the ticket was truly extortionate but we felt we had put him in a position of safety.  On the day, due to industrial action which we were not notified of, he ended up being shunted from train to train making a total of four changes and never actually reaching his final destination as we picked up a station before to save him the stress of yet another change.  He was almost three hours late on the original arrival schedule and Cross Country are refusing to refund the cost of the ticket because he neglected to keep track of what times he got onto the various trains he was forced to use.  He was just intent on getting home in one piece. Taking notes of times was not part of his plan for the day, he just went where he was told to go in a state of confusion and panic that robbed him of his dignity.  The lack of humanity and decency displayed by Cross Country trains is abhorrent.  Don't use them."
749,Truly dreadful trains at vastly inflated prices,"Took the 18.15 from Reading to Macclesfield once a week every week last year. Nearly 3 hours to travel 170 miles.  Only once tried standard class - utterly vile.  Scrum to get on.  Old small seats so packed up against other people with nowhere to put a suitcase.   Had to upgrade (at my own not employer expense) to first class just to get a seat.  Too few carriages resulting in appalling inhumane overcrowding.  People pressed against the glass like flies, and sitting/standing in every available inch of toilets, carriages and corridors.  Surprisingly little abuse from  passengers - in France there'd be riots if people were treated this badly.  Grotty trolley clatters eventually through in first class and had to pay for 'dinner' in the form of the measly overpriced cheese & pickle sandwich, crisps and warm wine or warm beer.  (Eventually cracked and now travel from Slough to Paddington across London to get to Euston for a 'proper' Virgin train home.  Not much better but less stressful).   Typical CrossCountry first class booked online in advance ticket price: around £250 return.  Shocker.  Avoid."
750,Appalling service,"Appalling service, the sooner some competition is allowed the better. Further to my negative review 3 days ago Eurostar's response is below, very dissappointing, gone are the days when they'd offer a free ticket unconditionally. Good will out of the window. This cuts both ways. I shall now use them as a last resort and make others aware of their poor standards:"
751,The worst customer service imaginable,"The worst customer service imaginable. Abrasive staff, no attempt at an apology for cancelled trains, total lack of people at information desk or ticket office at St Pancras. Whilst stood at the information desk I had to telephone their helpline to get any assistance. The sooner their monopoly is ended and the likes of Deutschebahn are allowed to use the tunnel the better!!!"
752,Ryanair on tracks! appalling customer service,"Eurostar charged me £10 for my mistake when i booked the wrong date online despite calling them immediately after. not about the money, just about the customer experience. you are killing your brand!"
753,Paid for a premiere class trip to paris…,"Paid for a premiere class trip to paris from London for two, on the return journey the carriage stank of sewage and the staff admitted there was a problem but did nothing about it.  Followed the Eurostar complaint procedure and no one ever bothers to return a call or reply.  Has been a couple of months now and still no response from Eurostar.  Absolutely disgraceful company and will never use them again"
754,Worst customer service ever by an agent…,"Aniko : Worst customer service ever by an agent at London St Pancras International. , her name is Aniko and she is a special assistance leader.  She completely ruined our experience. We’ve been Eurostar travellers since 2008 but this is the first time we have to give a bad review. Just because of One agent who doesn’t smile , doesn’t treat people equally and is fairly racist."
755,Rude staff from beginning to end,Rude staff from beginning to end
756,Worst customer experience,My family and I were traveling to Paris from London on a vacation with small kids. We already had the tickets and as we tried to go through the check-in process they told us we were a few minutes late so we needed to find a a new time.  As we went to try and change our tickets they told us there were no available tickets for another 3 to 4 days.
757,Genuine error or racist service?,Genuine error or racist service?
758,Terrible Service,"Good afternoon,"
759,just OK,just OK summer will be busy
760,getting better!,getting better!
761,Disneyland on Eurostar,"We were due to go to Disneyland Paris via Lille on Monday 14th May. At the time of booking we did not know about the train strikes in France. The day before we where due to leave I got a email from the French train network. Most of it was in French, understandably, so I didn't understand it but I managed to work out that it said that our connecting train in Lille had been cancelled. I phoned Eurostar, who had made no attempt to tell me this, who said it had not been cancelled. I checked the French train network website which reported that it had been cancelled. I phoned back again and this time they admitted they had made a mistake and the connection had been cancelled. If I had not checked myself then I could have been stranded in Lille with my 2 year old son on the word of a Eurostar customer services call handler. Appalled! Will never use Eurostar again!"
762,"Normally Eurostar is OK, but don't make a booking until the SNCF strikes finish","Normally Eurostar is OK, I use them about 10 times per year and things generally work (even at the notorious Paris terminal).  But they have really struggled with managing the impact of the SNCF strikes in April.  I have had three sets of reservations cancelled because of this, but couldn't change them on line (other than for extortionate prices, even though the advice page claimed I could change them for free) nor get through to their call centre to change them at all over many attempts.  This meant I could not be sure of travelling on any particular train back from Dresden via Brussels to London so I went by plane instead.  You should be aware that, if you do make a booking with Eurostar, the most they will give you back in such a situation is the fare paid with no compensation.  When I did get through to the call centre (about 10 days after I got back), there was no question of a compensation ticket for another time because their 'policy when things go wrong' has been watered down.  Because I had booked sometime in advance, the fare paid was nowhere what it actually cost to get back that day (8th April).  It was a poor experience all round, even BA managed better last May during their power outage.  My advice:  don't make ANY bookings with them whilst the strikes continue, you will be left on your own if the train is cancelled!!!"
763,No customer care or empathy,No customer care or empathy! Exactly like previous reviews.
764,COMPLETELY agree with previous reviews,COMPLETELY agree with previous reviews. Following the strikes in France my travel has been changed and moved to a different time (unsuitable as both my partner and would have to change our shifts around to suit this). When calling the call center I have been told that there are NO other available trains for us to get on and that is the only one. When I have gone onto the website I have managed to change my trains for a £200 fee & different price bracket. This is absolutely ridiculous as this is NOT what I agreed to but obviously now the holiday is booked and at ONE WEEK from departure there's not really much we can do. NEVER travelling with Eurostar again. Complete rip off.
765,"Zero customer care, respect or empathy.","There's too much of a story behind why I am leaving a bad review but in essence, during the last bout of French rail strikes, our experience of Eurostar service, and the subsequent lack of customer care afterwards, was quite frankly, appalling."
766,Entente not so Cordiale…,Travelled on Friday 20th from St Pancras to Lille and was not impressed by rudeness of Security staff. I was wearing a new jacket which at the last minute I was told to remove and the staff took it and laid it carelessly on top of my luggage. It  ended up shredded  in the conveyor and covered in oil. Had it not been for my husband speaking fluent French we wouldn't have had anyone to help us. Eventually we were taken aside and it took so long to find a form we nearly missed the train.The staff were so rude as if we were about to be charged for something. Not necessary at all ! The form I was given had the wrong email address for contact and I have spent all morning trying to find the correct email. To add insult to injury we were given incorrect info regarding the strike and we had to rebook our seats to get a seat four hours later.We spent £40 on a taxi to Lille Station to get accurate info  as on line details were contradictory. Not impressed at all .In Lille's favour the staff were far more obliging ! Our on going connections from Euston were totally messed up and the day ended splendidly 12 hours later with trains still out of action on the route to Blackpool. Cest.la vie....plus ca change !
767,Awful Eurostar experience.,Awful experience using the Eurostar travelling from Paris Gare du Nord to London St Pancras. We boarded the train and upon arrival discovered our seats had been taken by two other passengers. After failing to move the other two customers who had boarded incorrectly we were asked to move which wouldn’t have been a problem however we were expected to be split up which we weren’t prepared to do and after having to stand for the first half an hour of our journey and being spoken to rudely by staff including being sworn at it was discovered there was two seats together all along... As well as the terrible journey Euro star failed to respond in a satisfactory manor after the events not responding for two weeks after my initial complaint and then once I finally received a reply it was a very unconvincing acknowledgment of the events and that they will look into them. Since this I haven’t heard from Euro star at all and I would not recommend anyone to use this service due to their complete lack of customer service both on the train and via their complaints department.
768,Loved it but a few negatives,"My wife and I travelled from Paris to London on 14th April 2018. We were both impressed. The staff at Paris were extremely busy due to this being in the middle of the union strikes in Paris but were pleasant and helpful in every respect. The train itself was clean, comfortable and again the staff on board pleasant and engaging. The negatives: Paris Gare du Nord is not set up properly for Eurostar. The queuing system is a shambles but I'm sure this is due to lack of space. One or two more staff would ease the problems of group bookings just pushing through lines that have been halted due to congestion and more money needs to be invested into the customs process.(this is no fault of Eurostar ). If you are travelling standard or premium standard be prepared to queue and re queue and allow yourself plenty of time. Even with these negatives we found it a totally enjoyable experience."
769,Lack of transparency and faulty website,"I am sharing my experience in the hopes to prevent someone from going through the same thing. Due to a glitch on the website, I found myself with my destinations reversed. My tickets were now useless and as I was told not refundable even though I had taken an insurance. The said insurance was supposed to cover the cancellation fees but it was not advertised that economy tickets were not refundable. Thanks to Eurostar I wasted 300 pounds. So I urge anyone wanting to travel with this company (I would advise you not to but should you anyway) to check about a good hundred times where you are going and when and not to waste more of your money on a useless insurance."
770,"Eurostar took 3 payments out for the same ticket, charging £530 extra!","A £265 journey was charged 3 times on my credit card by their web-site. They only sent me 1x ticket by email, so I only realised they'd over-charged once I checked my credit card statement. It then took me 30 minutes to get this sorted with their call-centre to get £530 refunded onto my credit card. They then tell me it can take 28 days to get this back. Call center staff unhelpful, initially didn't even apologise, then refused to offer any goodwill gesture even though they tried to rip me off £530. Poor service overall."
771,Oh I wish I had read Trustpilot before booking,This is not so much a train company as an expensive and uncomfortable way to travel.
772,I have taken eurostar frequently for 10…,I have taken eurostar frequently for 10 years but the service and respect for passengers particularly at the London end  has become atrocious .
773,Avoid if you can,Avoid if you can :
774,Rude staff,"Rude staff, awful website, absolute chaos at both London and Paris ends. I can’t quite get how you can get running trains so badly wrong. It’s so so disappointing and really stressful. Actually when you’re on the train it’s quite nice but every other part of the “experience” is terrible."
775,No refund,"No refund. No confirmation of refund claim. We had a delay of 3 hours, and are entitled to some compensation. But the whole story about being able to claim a refund is a lie. It is a waste of time. It is just a dead letter box."
776,[EuroStar review]We went to Paris with our school and we didn’t get our seats!!!,We went to Paris with our school and booked many seats and at least 50 of us didn’t get seats. Don’t ride with this s***ty company. I would rate this not even a f**kng star. The staff is really selfish and said WE WERE HOLDING UP THE BLOODY TRAIN actually they were because they said our seats were taken when we book them in advance.
777,Our train from Brussels to London was…,Our train from Brussels to London was cancelled (with our train out being 55 mins late arriving!) and Eurostar was unable to offer another booking that day meaning my wife and I had to stay overnight and get the first train back to London the next day.
778,Poor service ttm!!!,Poor service. Give me the what the hell can i do look when the train got cancelled and delayed...
779,Faulty website and unhelpful customer service,Always enjoyed using Eurostar until my most recent experience.
780,Crap service.You need to arrrive 60…,"Crap service.You need to arrrive 60 mins before a train departs. And they do not have this on the front of their E tickets, like for example, everybody else. If you do not read the fine print on the tickets under the information section you will be paying an additional £44 for not realising this."
781,I gave it 1 star because I met a nice lady on board only,I gave it 1 star because I met a nice lady to chat to. Check in at St Pancras is AWFUL. You are pushed around in line by people who love moving the elastic band that keeps you tied in only to cause more confusion and stress. They are clueless at who to send where all the time you are lugging children and bags. There were 4 trains and my suggestion to those who should know better.
782,Poor overall first time experience,Check in was crowded with passengers herded like cattle. Staff less than couteous. Train was packed and stuffy on the way to Paris. No aircon. Left with little time for my connecting train in Paris.
783,No internet. Disappointed!,No internet.
784,Ive been thinking of going away for a…,Ive been thinking of going away for a weekend trip to visit my family who live in Bruxelles and thought i would use Eurostar. When i went online to book i was shocked to find out how much they are charging their customers.   i feel that they have been given a licence to print money and they are taking full advantage.  I was going to  travel with my  family of four.  The price was coming to £800 just for the weekend . How can they be allowed to get away with charging such an extortionate fare for a train journey that is no more than London to Manchester.  If their is more demand than roll out more trains dont rip the working man off
785,Eurostar overbook their trains beware,"Booked tickets on eurostar web site 6 people very expensive. Arrived at station to be told sorry train is overbooked you cannot travel. After much fuss finally told we could stand in the aisle with all of our luggage which meant we blocked the passage to the buffet and the loo for other passengers who were not happy. There were others in a similar position apparently its ok for eurostar to take money from people and not provide the seat !! Staff unhelpful basically didnt care at all. Return journey train didnt stop at Ashford ""new trains"" unsuitable for the platform so passengers sent to Ebbsfleet then herded back via normal train again unhelpful rude staff. Customer service dont answer phones email gets generic reply. How does this company get away with it !!! be warned !!"
786,Booked bikes did not arrive!,"Booked four bikes on a 15.14 train on Saturday at an extra £40 each. Arrived on train to collect bikes at St Pancras but Eurostar had not put the bikes on the train. Waited for the next train when three of the four bikes arrived, one was still in Paris. Not helpful as we needed to cycle out of London. Had to take a taxi (£60) as we cannot get four on three bikes. Promised bikes would be sent home to Bristol. Wednesday morning, still no bikes and they are still in London. One person needed it for getting to work. Don’t return calls or do as they promise. Very disappointing"
787,I found the seats quite uncomfortable…,I found the seats quite uncomfortable compared with SNCF trains. There were no grab rails in toilets and the train was an hour late.
788,I have been recently travelling with…,"I have been recently travelling with eurostar. The train has been cancelled, needed to spend the night over in London. They claimed to refund expenses up to £250, now they are stating that I'm due £154.90 in expense, making me loose £60."
789,Never again! Only by plane from London to Paris,I've been frequently travelling between London and Paris for many years now. For pleasure as well as for business.
790,Eurostar- forget it!,"Shocking experience in gare de nord on our way back to London. Clearly the set up is absolutely not capable of processing a large train load of people that turn up between half hour and an hour before the train is supposed to leave! Hundreds of people in mass queues taking 45 minutes to get through check in, then French passport control, then uk passport control, then security, then another queue waiting for boarding! Awful experience!"
791,Yesterday,"Yesterday, I took the Eurostar from Paris Gare Ddu Nord to London: the French physiometric custom gates do not work, the staff of Eurostar and French customs do not care; customs officers are violent, harassing (get super close to you, push you, check your bag in all directions, ask you for your eurostar ticket that you have had three times checked by their friends !!!). Awful, rude, violent and horrendous experience. And the Eurostar staff in Paris: but what horror they are not involved in their work and the notion of good ""customer service"" is completely foreign to them. Cows."
792,Carte blanche to erase your points - no loyalty no doubt!,"Update 11/03: Eurostar finally agreed to take into account points earned from trips made before the introduction of Club Eurostar. However Eurostar will not re-calculate status points from previous trips using the new system, it will just consider the status points earned under the previous scheme. This is unfair because status points under the previous scheme were harder to accrue but the point threshold to reach Carte Blanche status was much lower."
793,Poor customer service,"I travel on Eurostar almost weekly and frequently I need to change journey and/or ticket. I have constantly encountered poor customer service even after new web site went live. Now I need to change my next journey and the website keeps indicating that no trains run on the selected date. However, if I wanted to buy a new ticket for that same date the website would allow me to do so. As Carte Blanche member I have tried to get in touch with the dedicated telephone number for the last two days without success. No success with general customer service number either. I am growing increasingly frustrated and found myself to spend more on BA lately than on Eurostar. I forgot to mention that the the web chat had been equally unavailable any time I tried to connect to it. Please get your act together!"
794,Terrible communication and customer service,"I travelled with eurostar on 26th December. I called before regarding special assistance as my son is autistic and large crowds/queues etc cause high anxiety and stress and causes him to vomit amongst other things. I was told to arrive 90minutes early and go to the assistance desk and we would be helped. I did this and also took proof of my sons issues with me. The man took one look at my husband and I our 3 suitcases, our 7 year old son, our 2 year old daughter an practically laughed. He said you have him with you to help with children and bags why are you here?"
795,Eurostar simply doesn’t care about you - nil points.,"Eurostar reviewed its frequent traveller scheme in September 2017. It first communicated changes via emails to its customer database in vague and positive terms promoting transfer of its ‘reward’ points on a 1:1 basis. It neglected to inform that it’s tier/status points - to provide benefits for travel - would be reset to zero for all members at launch in December 2017.  For customers who accrued points during 2017 it knowingly issued worthless points during the year without any transparency. In communication with its Customer ‘Care’ team their autopilot response deems this abuse of monopoly both ‘fair’ and ‘a level playing field’ for its customers. Without consideration it penalises and disappoints travellers who have desired to access premium level benefits for frequent or premium level tickets. It’s cursory, ill conceived and ill communicated ‘marketing’ campaign has angered many travellers by erasing their travel history, loyalty, and shows through it's website what appears to be a deliberate intent to remove previous tier status questions from its FAQ sections. Delve into the small print and the Club Eurostar 'terms and conditions' prominently state transition conditions for its reward points, yet omits to inform that status points will be reset to nil. In direct communication it takes a dismissive and unqualified ‘this matter is closed’ stance to queries to avoid resolution. Their approach to customer service suggests a significant backlog of complaints measured only by achieving a ‘cases closed’ metric of success. Further research shows it’s CEO, Nicolas Petrovic, was previously Director of Customer Services which worryingly indicates a detached and dismissive approval of a revised loyalty scheme that alienates it’s most precious and valuable core customers. Eurostar deserves it’s one star status (trust pilot does not offer zero star reviews) for its arrogant approach to customer ‘care’. Lets be clear that Eurostar disappoints in many key customer performance areas, and this subject is just one of many failures highlighting the brand's continued decline. A worthless and disappointing enterprise abusing its monopoly."
796,I have just come off the phone after …,Final Post
797,False pricing advertised on the website,"Please be aware that Eurostar website provides false pricing. I was trying to book online, and after I've put all my card details, every time I pressed pay now, the quoted ticket price was going up by £40! They claimed that tickets in this price sold out (even though there were 9 tickets available at this price). After deleting cookies, the old price came back. I tried to book on my phone, other browser etc, and every time the price went up by £40! So they show you one pricing grid and try to scam you when you're ready to book by saying that the tickets sold out (when they clearly didn't)."
798,One of the worse customer service is history,"Why are the people answering the phones at Eurostar so unhelpful and unwilling to do anything for their customers I will never understand, considering that’s their main job, is shocking how unhelpful some of them are. I am experiencing difficulties to sign in to my account to purchase train tickets, but got of the phone with a man by the name of Dom- and I just felt that he was not interested in helping, and just told me to keep trying to do the same things I told him I had already done but didn’t work, when asked if I could speak to someone else, he said no one else is available right now ... frustrating."
799,Pleasant journey,"I had a very pleasant experience on the Eurostar Brussels - London - Brussels in December 2017.   Got there 45 mins ahead of departure and queue was not too bad.  Check-in at Brussels Midi was as expected, go through 2 passport controls - one for leaving Belgium and the other for entering the UK. I was in Standard Premier.  X-ray is always a pain though as you have to lift your luggage up onto the belt.  Was served snack / breakfast on board with a croissant, roll, marmalade and butter, juice and coffee or tea.  Also a good selection of newspapers and magazines."
800,EUROSTAR - A Service Designed by Felonious Gru from 'Despicable Me'!,"Despite the shiny outward image this company attempts to create, there underlies an organisation that is mean, incompetent and totally un-customer foccussed. Since inception of the service some 20 years ago there has been a significant decline in customer service."
801,In the dark ages with customer service.,Very poor I have to use the service all the time and have many bad experiences. If you lose a ticket with proof you paid for the service the jobs worths will not see sense and just assume you are a fraudulent vilan . Also stupid website you need to accept a cookie to read their cookie policy. Trains are often double stacked at Marylebone and people get on the wrong one because the announcements do not state this. No idea of customer service.
802,BEWARE - wrong ticket times confirmations sent. not what you selected and confirm ed several times!,"BEWARE. selected tickets for my journey for end of June online. Selected times and dates, added to the basket, confirmed, checked the details, confirmed again. redirected- confirmed again. Paid. Email confirmation arrived - wrong train times! ..called Chiltern.... guess what... its apparently my fault that i didn't check on the 5th confirmation page that their website changed my tickets times for no reason at all!"
803,Rude staff at Moor Street,"Rude staff at Moor Street when trying to reclaim tickets when I lost my travel pass - got told that it was the ticket issuers (West Midlands Railway), not the pass issuers (Chiltern), even though the Network West Midlands site says that the pass holder is liable."
804,Comfortable return journey,"We had a comfortable return journey from Warwick Parkway to London, all to time, all as one would hope. The ticket office staff at Warwick Parkway are always helpful and friendly. However I seem to think that weekend fares now have much fewer advance purchase bargains. And I do think it was a big mistake for Chiltern to effectively withdraw their service into Stratford / Stratford Parkway which must make RSC theatre visits a real trial for many not living close by - very shortsighted."
805,BEWARE Parking at Bicester Village train station.,"Be advised that the parking spaces at bicester village are now nearly always full very early in the morning.  Don’t bother with Ringo as it doesn’t tell you this when you book the space, nor does Chiltern Railways either."
806,The ride on the new E320 trains is …,"The ride on the new E320 trains is awful. wobbly, bumpy and feels unsafe."
807,Poor Software and horrific customer …,Poor Software and horrific customer service
808,Problems with my account.,Very happy with the timing and the comfort of the trains but on many occasions i can not log in into my account.
809,its a s h i t  company with a weak …,"its a s h i t  company with a weak website, not investing enough in new technologies. errors are coming up, and s h i t ....."
810,Unclear check-in procedure and unhelpful staff,"I have used Eurostar regularly in the past but have not travelled on it for a couple of years. Changes have been made to the check-in process but this is not in any way clear from the email confirmation, and consequently I was not allowed on the train."
811,Rude staff at Kings Cross,I have just had the pleasure of meeting the rudest member of staff at Londons Kings Cross/St Pancreas Premier check in. After panicking all the way here after having trains cancelled or delayed we made it with 40 mins to spare so thought we should just about make it. Until we met their horrendous member of staff. She complained to us that we were late and that we might not get in. So I was panicking and said 'ok lets try the gate' she replied by saying that if I was going to be like that I had to go to the ticket office and then would not give my tickets back when I asked her. I then tried to take them back and she snatched them away and told me not to snatch... my own tickets. She then started swearing in french. I eventually had to speak to a less irrational member of staff which seemed to change the womans mind and she gave our tickets back. The whole time she complained that she had been working since 4am and that people were late and rude to her. She obviously shouldn't be working in a customer based job. Horrendous customer service and would rather swim the channel than use Eurostar again.
812,On Eurostar from London to Paris,"On Eurostar from London to Paris, on time and friendly service. From Paris to London, we arrived 30 mins before departure as suggested. We were ushered into a queue with people with all sorts of timed tickets. They called out 7.13 train and were shocked to find at least 15 people still in the queue at 7.00. they made a poor effort of prioritising those with the earliest train time. We arrived to find we were already allocated to the next train with 5 mins to go before departure. No apology was offered and no real effort was made to get everyone on their allocated train even when we arrived on time. Sadly, Eurostar Paris were unable to fulfil the basic requirement of their service. Organising people to board the train."
813,yet another dismal day at eurostar,"yet another dismal day at eurostar: asking to change my ticket to an earlier train, was assured ""that is easy-just present yourself to Gate A. Gate A says (3 minutes later)  ""boarding is closed !"" (20 minutes before departure) while actually, another 20 or so passenger passed through the boarding gate. The answer to this puzzle: the customer rep could not be bothered. Overall the waiting area at Gar du Nord has improved, somewhat, St Pancras decidedly not. Rat infestation remains an issue - as at Gar Du Nord -  (customer rep just shrug their shoulders when I pointed to  a rat on the seat next to me); the train experience remains one of the worst in Europe (based on having travelled eurostar for many years now)...poor food choice (cafe metropol as well as in standard and business premier), shame on Raymond Blanc for giving his name to this -  yet again no magazines, breakfast unchanged for years, poorly trained staff, WIFI virtually non existent.  Overcrowded train. When I complain, at best, I receive a ""sorry"". NOW BEING ASKED TO CONTACT EUROSTAR SEPARATELY BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO NO BOOKING REFERENCE,  - PLEASE DO ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO WILL HERE FROM EUROSTAR TO ADDRESS ANYTHING. Update: a further complaint received no response again"
814,Appalling service and very expensive ticket on Eurostar website,After buying my ticket last night. I have went and checked again to see if I get reasonable prices from Eurostar website and of course not I found out that I have been robed for the same ticket I bought I paid £150 extra....I feel totally  ripped off I would never ever use Eurostar
815,Excellent organisation,"Excellent organisation after a gig at Wembley, ensuring we got back safely."
816,"Good service, nice trains, website & wifi could be better!","The silverline trains are great, spacious & comfortable & a nice layout with a good number of tables all with powerpoints. The free wifi used to be great but now very restrictive & often intermittent. Service is reliable and good to London from Birmingham, rarely delays or cancellations. The website needs a lot of work despite some recent improvements. All in all a good service & a lot better than other operators on different routes, so thank you, but keep improving that website please!"
817,'We're not getting there',"So we arrive at Gerrards Cross station in good time for our train to London. Now, whilst this is a sunny Saturday and not a mega busy weekday there are nevertheless quite a few travellers after trains."
818,Tried to book via an ipad - Updated,"Tried to book via an ipad, but process failed as the verified by VISA page as the site didnt seem to account for the scrolling required to fill in this box with all the details. Clicked back and re-booked with another card only to discover that the dates had reverted to a previous date for the outbound so I'm now left with paying the fee's to change the dates. As others have commented charging £30 admin fee per person per leg is not representative of the actual cost to change this especially with bookings made months in advance and is just sheer profiteering!"
819,Sharp Practice,"Spent even more time explaining to their customer services what had happened, because I thought it was a technical error, however they admitted that they keep changing the price, especially if they have just a few seats left. It was like getting a trolley full of food at a supermarket only to be told at the checkout that they are raising all the prices of the food in your trolley because you took the last items off the shelf.  Sharp practice and very poor.  I would strongly recommend that anyone wanting Eurostar tickets buys them via Last Minute.com as this was honest and easy compared with Eurostar website."
820,A normal day no delays but poor,"A normal day no delays, queues to do everything, passports, security, food, shops drink, no seats. An airline like experience"
821,Always late and unreliable,I have yet to catch a Eurostar from Paris to London on time. It is absolutely ridiculous.
822,Out of touch admin fees,"I needed to change the weekend we planned to travel from London to Paris, for myself and my husband.  I was fully expecting some sort of admin fee, but the fees I learned about were ridiculous.  £30 per person, per leg of the journey.  So to change our tickets to another weekend, we would have to pay £120!  This is 80% of the ticket price.  This is not representative of the amount of work involved, and I don't understand how anyone can think this is a normal charge."
823,Awful organisation at London,Awful organisation at London. Complete chaos and no better since I travelled 6 months ago so they clearly don’t care about customers or the service. The queue for security takes over one hour but they say only allow an hour there is very little control of the queue and so lots of people push in and queue jump. If you allow one hour and queue honestly prepare to miss the train and expect no sympathy from the staff.
824,Terrible customer service and dishonest staff,We travelled on the Eurostar from London to Brussels and were looking forward to the claim it would only take two hours!  However the train was delayed so we kept waiting and waiting and waiting with no real information about when we would leave.
825,EUROSTAR fail! THEY WILL NEVER BE OUR FIRST CHOICE FOR TRAVEL,"EUROSTAR fail! such a disappointment .. our train got cancelled, no customer service was provided at the time ABSOLUTE FAIL! ... we ended up driving last minute so we don’t loose out on our trip and activities and MIGHTY EUROSTAR is so poor they can’t even compensate the excess of less than £100 that we incurred above the cost of our ticket (not even mentioning stress incurred and travelling whole night for a weekend break booked in advance which was 2k... we chose alternative route because we didn’t want to miss out as no one would give us a refund and we didn’t have any other choice because no one from EUROSTAR bothered to show up or advice other than go in their website - which was crashing all the time - AS EXPECTED and tickets available for next day at reasonable time were all gone!) ... well done EUROSTAR! ... i would think twice before choosing your service again!"
826,Follow up review,Follow up review. If only there was minus stars.
827,The train is working great but NOT the booking web site,The train is working great (when it's working). However this review is about the web site which is the worst booking site ever.
828,My friend and I were looking for a …,"My friend and I were looking for a daytime fare from London to Paris on Nov 7, 2017 and there were no fares for $61, which was the cheapest fare, available. We ended up reserving for a train that would put us in Paris almost at midnight for that price. The ticket was bought last week, and all of a sudden, last night, it appeared that there was a daytime train for the price, after all. We went ahead and changed the time and date for a train that put us in Paris around 11:30am, but we had to pay $48 penalty per person to switch it. Really Eurostar? What kind of predatory tactic is this? I see that the penalty information is visible right before you make the change, but at the end of the day, it is inconceivable to feel OK about paying pretty much for two extra tickets, when all we wanted was to get to Paris at a decent time; and to top it off, you state that if the price is higher at the time of the change, you have to pay the penalty PLUS the difference in fare, BUT if the new fare is lower, then NO  refund would be issued. I mean, regardless of your business reason for doing so, it really hurts to be out almost $100 to exchange a ticket for a different time on the same day for the same price. This is shameful! Shameful!"
829,Getting there at last!,"I have used Eurostar several times and saw it as an efficient way of reaching the continent. However, my most recent experience has changed my name somewhat. Granted, I decided to travel Standard Premier from London to Brussels and a week later from Paris back to London. Both were very good but the last journey on 14 October was outstanding. The comfort, food and the staff were very impressive and I hope that they have finally started to get their act together. The terminal in Paris has improved but still does not compare with St Pancras. I just question why they do not give passengers more time to board at the ST Pancras end. Overall, I have to give them credit for the improvement and hope that the trend will continue."
830,Cancelled our train which was bad …,Cancelled our train which was bad enough although possibly unavoidable but....refused to compensate our hotel stay that we paid for and lost the money for at NO FAULT of our own!! Very disappointed and disgusted at that awful customer service. Do not know how they can justify us being out of pocket when they cancelled the train and couldn’t make arrangements for us to even go the next day! This meant 2 nights hotel stay paid for and lost. Sorry Eurostar but this is NOT ACCEPTABLE!
831,Obviously a great technological …,"Obviously a great technological achievement, Eurostar is let down by its awful customer service (as a regular customer, I faced problems time and time again and the lack of communication is astounding) and its very high prices. They're also trying to sell you a ""long haul flight"" experience with on board entertainment via wifi, but don't be fooled: the wifi NEVER works."
832,Would use again,"On time, clean and comfortable, hassle free, would definately use again!"
833,Online booking system is a shambles - will not use again,"The online booking system took my bookings for three tickets for three people and put them in the name of one person with slight variation on the one name. Used the online chat who told me after some time they could do nothing and I’d have to call in the morning, didn’t tell me whether what I saw was ok, this is how system works or whether this was an error. Called customer services this morning and seems my 9 minute wait to get someone on the line was very good compared to the time some people have waited. The customer service rep said this is not the first time he’d seen this (then why isn’t it fixed) suggested it could be auto fill (then why were there variations in the single name?) and why did I see three distinct names in the entry boxes? The rep cancelled my booking and entered for new tickets but no idea if the insurance I took out or the food I ordered is still valid??"
834,Error ordering,"Ridiculous and irritating customer service. I tried to book two train tickets from London to Paris 10days ago. Error page popped up after I entered the credit card details. I didn't get to the page saying successful transaction and I didn't receive any confirmation email either. I called my bank and they said the money had been charged. Then I emailed them, no words back over the ten days and I called a few times, just long waiting with annoying music. What is the hotline for if there is no one picking up calls? I am still GBP 115 out of pocket. And it is so rude that no one from the company offers any help or support or even an answer."
835,Disabled Assistance,Our trip was from St Pancras to Marseille.
836,Eurostar - worst customer service,"Neither EuroDespatch nor Eurostar wish to carry bikes / so beware! You can only take your bike on trains to Paris , Lille and Brussels - that's all. ( forget about going to Calais etc .. they aren't interested). There are many restrictions and contacting them is difficult. You have to buy the passenger rail ticket first with Eurostar  - then contact a second company called EuroDespatch to book your bike ( hoping that there is space for the bike on the same train ). My email was answered after 12 days .. and I phoned EuroDespatch dozens of times on their published number - and it was never answered. Totally hopeless. I sincerely hope the management are all sacked."
837,Eurostar Customer Service non-existent,Would like to give zero for customer service. On 7th Sept an error on their website gave me tickets for the wrong date £176 was debited. I spotted the error as soon as I got the confirmation and sent an email. I was then able to recreate their error and sent a second email with an attachment demonstrating the problem. No acknowledgement nor any reply. Tried phoning three times and gave up waiting. After  a week I went to the eurostar office at St Pancras. They said they couldn't help with the online system. Normally they would ring but they don't bother now as its an hour wait. Suggested I wait longer for a reply. I waited another week and sent a further email titled formal complaint. Still no response. I'll give St Pancras another go as I'm still £176 out of pocket.
838,BOOKING WEBSITE IS HORRENDOUS,"Unfortunately, I need to book many Eurostar tickets for staff members on a regular basis.  The website is HORRENDOUS.  It constantly fails to recognise my log-in details (a fact that a staff member told me happens to them all the time too).  Today, so far I have tried to book the same ticket 3 times and it keeps telling me it cannot accept my payment - it is really the most annoying website to deal with.  If I reluctanly have to call them to book it for me they will charge ME an extra £10 for calling THEM. It is very, very frustrating."
839,Beware rip-off exchange rate,"The check in process is as smooth as can be expected for international travel these days and certainly better than most airports. However, in 2nd class the legroom is less than mainline GWR services in the UK."
840,Inflexible and poor offering for customers,"They won't change the destination on my ticket, even if I offer to pay for the amendment - Or passenger details. They charge you £30 just to amend date and time too, on top of fare difference! I have now lost £200  - and you lost this customer I'm afraid unless you can sort it out :( Looking forward to seeing what you have to say."
841,Charlie Macauley,"I was queuing at the security thing with my luggage and a large Costa Americano. I was concerned that I would not be able to take my recently purchased, piping hot and much loved coffee through security. However a very kind gentleman named Charlie Macauley allowed me to take the coffee through, and even provided a coffee holder to take the coffee through the security scanner without spilling. He was great banter and a very kind man. He also wished me a happy holiday. Eurostar, please give this man a payrise. Because of him we will most certainly be using Eurostar again, and recommending it to friends. Excellent customer service. Well done and thank you Macauley!"
842,Unbelievable no refund possible,Unbelievable that they are fast at accepting you money but you can not get it back if you are unable to travel even with a week before the trip. You can get an other ticket but then you have to pay 30 pound and have a fixed date!
843,Hard to review when you can't even book a ticket!,"The website is pathetic. Trying to book a ticket from London to Paris, but every time I try to get a price it comes up with ""Oops - something went wrong""."
844,Unacceptable customer service,"On the one hand Eurostar consider rescheduling of your train by 12 minutes (without even warning you) to be ""a small amendment"" but arrive ""only"" 25 minutes in advance and you'll be fined 40 EUR/GBP for being late."
845,Very bad for travel with tiny tots,Appalling service at Marne le vallee chessy station on Monday 6th March.
846,bad company rip off,"i cant believe that euro star charge £30 per person each way to exchange to a different date so that means i have to pay £120 for 2 people just to change my date even though its 1 week away and unfortunately to work reasons, im shocked they they dont do refunds or part exchange without charging a fortune! i wont be using this company in the future id rather miss out then pay the extra fees its ridiculous, we are all not made of money, the staff are absolute helpless people with no sympathy."
847,excellent customer service,"Cannot fault Eurostar, polite and professional and can't do enough for you. Lisa in particular who works at the help desk was a superstar and couldn't be more helpful when we missed our train, what could of been an expensive disaster and potential mini break ruiner was saved by her. Many thanks again Lisa, you deserve a raise :)"
848,The unacceptably rude and selfish behaviour of Eurostar,"I cannot express in words how much I urge you all not to travel with Eurostar. Eurostar is a greedy company obsessed with money and filled with rude and unsympathetic staff. I don't think they have any compassion for their customers and I honestly think they see each one as a walking wallet, rather than a human being with a beating heart."
849,Seat to Brussels changed without notification,"I've had some very good experiences with Eurostar in the past, but it's going downhill. Extremely annoyed that I wasn't informed they had changed my window forward facing seat that was carefully chosen 3 months ago to a backwards facing aisle seat - apparently they decided to use my original carriage for business class. Why couldn't they e-mail me and let me choose a new seat - or a different train. Eventually I was given a forward facing seat right beside the constantly opening door to the very noisy kitchen car. Really rubbish and not a great start to my EU evaluation week."
850,The most awful travel experience,I travelled on the Eurostar to and from Amsterdam on 30 December 2016 and 2 January 2017 and was frankly disgusted with the service in its entirety.
851,Checkin Policy and Horrible Customer Service,Had the worst experience with Eurostar this morning. Horrid way to start your vacation. Suggest flying over using this company any day.
852,Never get refund. Useless cutomer service,I tried to surprise my wife bought two tickets to Paris but she unable to travel due to medical examinations. I try to get my money back but they never refund not even extending dates.
853,Next time I'll swim across,"Gare du Nord is a nightmare even by cheap airline standards - as you ascend towards the Eurostar section you are greeted by nice decor which eventually leads to a queue that I can only describe as a vicious nightmare at best - no structure or organization, and even cattle led to slaughter are treated better. I am being reassured that everyone is in the same position (as if I can't see that for myself) and after inevitably being late (nearly a full hour in the queue), I do not even receive an apology (or an explanation) and am simply handed a ticket for a train an hour later. At least they had the decency to ask whether I would like a 4 seat (with table) or 2 seat placement..."
854,Terrible Customer Service and Signage at Gare Du Nord,Eurostar:
855,Never take eurostar again.,"On wednesday, myself and 4 other friends went to brussel from london. We booked our tickets to catch the 6.50 train. Unfortunately we got there about 6.25, still 25 mins left to catch the train and it was not busy hours. staff there didn't let us through and each staff kept asking us to see a different staff and no one was a help and they were arrogant and aggressive, it was a disappointment that we have enough time and they were dragging us along. each one of us end up paying extra to catch the next train. we sit there for our next train and the boarding only started 15 mins before the departure. we see people walking in 5 mins before the departure to other trains and we feel that we were picked on and it was unfair. It ruined our morning and our trip, my friends and I wont travel on eurostar again and I wont encourage anyone to travel on eurostar again. they are greedy, rude and arrogant company."
856,I had THE BEST experience getting the Eurostar from Lille Europe to London st Pancras!!!,"So on Sunday evening I cleverly left my purse in the departure lounge at Lille (last week I left it in the airport in Zurich) and I didn't realise until I was already on my train (I know, I don't deserve to have one). Anyway, the amazingly quick witted managers Stefan and George managed to track me down and accompany my bag on the next train to London! I am so grateful to them and all of the staff. All I had to do was wait in the cushy confines of Pret a Manger, eating my egg mayo sandwich, until my purse was delivered to me in person by Stefan. If that's not great customer service then I don't know what is! In other news, the Eurostar cheese and ham toastie is delicious and the white wine not to Chablis...."
857,Awful customer service,"Took over one month to receive response to complaint about on board staff member who was aggressive and rude to me and my husband. The reply said, ""Sorry you FELT you were treated this way"", with no offer of trying to redeem the situation. Eurostar does not value its customers as it knows it has a monopoly in this area. Will be flying to Pairs and/or Brussels next time."
858,Worst experience on Eurostar,I arrived half an hour early for the Paris to St Pancras. Their systems had failed and we had to queue really far. I asked a lady holding up a sign whether I was missing my 7.13 am train at least 3 times and she told me I was on the right queue and to get back in the queue. At check in they said I was late and that I should buy a new ticket for 200 Euros from SNCF. They were not taking responsibility for their broken systems but quickly wanted me to pay for a new ticket. I looked for the manager who told me I could pay 40 Euros to catch another train but they had no clue when their own ticket office would be opening! What a strange state of affairs! Definitely some sort of scam  going on.
859,Must improve on free service,I travel a lot for work and use Eurostar very often
860,Not recommend! Poor customer services and rude agents.,I do not recommend!!!!
861,Poor customer service,"Me and my partner paid £300 each for tickets from Nice to St Pancreas. Train from Nice to Paris Gare De Lyon was delightful. Then we had to catch a train from Gare De Lyon to Paris Nord station, which was not clearly notified at all on the Eurostar website when we booked the tickets. We realised this on the train to Gare De Lyon so we realised we had to change station. This was a nightmare, no one spoke English and all the signage was in French. After finally getting to Paris Nord and into the Eurostar queue we were told we were 3 minutes late to check in. Went to the ticket office who tried charging £40 each to be put on the next train which was  1 hour later. Explained to the staff that there was no way that we could have got from one station to the other due to our circumstances and language barriers any faster and having paid for premium tickets we thought that been 3 minutes late was very mean, especially with the price we paid. They refused to listen to anything we had to say, and tried to make it our own wrong doing. Once we were on the train all was well though, on time and friendly staff. A very stressful experience with poor customer service, could so easily have been a pleasant journey."
862,Queued for over 2 hours at Gare de Nord …,"Queued for over 2 hours at Gare de Nord station.  No Eurostar staff to tell us why, no water handed out, nowhere to sit etc.  Once checked in we had to board immediately, no time to get something to eat or drink (unless you want to buy something on the train, which I would advise you avoid).  Customer services failed to address my complaint - volume of people when you presell tickets is NOT a valid excise nor is it the reason there were no staff to inform people or the excuse to treat people so badly.  Would NEVER chose to travel by Eurostar again, I'd prefer to spend my time travelling to an airport!"
863,I'm afraid this is another tale of woe,"I'm afraid this is another tale of woe.  My poor son went traveling to Paris with his friends for a break after his A levels.  They arrived half an hour before departure only to be told check-in closed 2 minutes ago.  Particularly galling as the train itself was late.  Staff were unhelpful, disrespectful to the youngsters and rude.  They smirked behind the small print and charged them £30 extra to go on a later train.  Remonstrating with customer service met with obtuse meaningless responses.  My advice is to avoid at all costs, especially if you are a young person on a budget.  Choose either to fly or catch the ferry.  Never had a problem with either of them."
864,God help you if you are delayed and …,God help you if you are delayed and need to claim compensation...their customer service is truly abysmal.
865,Poor Eurostar experience in Paris,"We travelled to Paris via Eurostar on 8th July and returned in 9th July. I was appaled at the poor service in Gare Du Nord on the return. The  queue management for immigration control was amateur at best. We had two children under 4 years and waited in a queue for about an hour only to find that as we got close to the stairs leading up to UK immigration control, at least 6 further queues had formed and people were jostling to get in. Eurostar staff were managing best they could but surely it should be possible for Eurostar to organise the queue to prevent the whole thing becoming farcical. The whole Eurostar experience was spoilt by this episode."
866,Terrible service,"Very often not possible to pay by card at the bar buffet, very limited options for food, no indication whatsoever on where the bar buffet is, wi fi not working, multiple delays all the time, making ""service stop"" at Lille for example for over 30 min. Someone needs to break their monopoly!"
867,Told there would be wifi not happing,"Told there would be wifi not happing , old trains sets stained carpets , plugs don't work"
868,I had a really bad experience with …,"I had a really bad experience with Eurostar. I went onto the website to change my outward journey from London - Paris. After I made all the changes selecting the new date and time, entered my credit card details and pressed submit, the website crashed and came back with an error message. Checking my emails to make sure I didn't get an email to confirm - I re- entered the information and my credit card again. On later checking my emails, I not only received an email for the intial time I tried to change and got an error message, I also received another email which changed my inbound journey back to London which was very strange as I did not even see the return date mentioned. Only having selected the outbound journey to amend. As I was travelling in the US at the time I automatically went onto the online help and communicated to a customer service person what had happened. I was advised by the customer service person to call the helpline to get the change made and I explained that I could not do this as I was travelling on an Australian mobile and the cost to do this would be too high. I asked the customer service representative to make a note on my record that I had been in contact and advised that I would call the customer service  line as soon as I got to the UK. I also sent an email explaining the situation, hoping that I would get a response prior to having to make the call. I followed up by email every day and received not a single reply."
869,Not enough time alert for first time Eurostar Passage,"Going to a romantic trip with my gf from London to Paris, yet found out when we get to the St. Pancras station that the check in closed 30 mins prior to departure.  There's no alert, at least nothing caught my attention when I purchased the train/hotel through Eurostar affiliate partner lastminute.com.  When I re-read the Eurostar print out ticket, there's some very small letters below some ads that tells you this -- who READS everything if there's ads in between; put it to bold or larger words if you really want to alert people."
870,"James, the Eurostar lifesaver",Got our tickets fixed by James. It took awhile but it's not his fault.
871,Beware the Eurostar ripoff,Travelled to Paris at the end of April. Beats flying. They now have new rolling stock. A lot more comfortable. The trains were looking decidedly tatty the last time we travelled.
872,Used to be great - not any more,"I've been travelling regularly between London & Brussels since 2004 and Eurostar has changed a lot: it used to be great but difficult to book without an agent, then it was even better - easy to book yourself and choose a seat, comfortable and great staff. Over the last few years all this has ebbed away and we're left with just the friendly, efficient staff, a poor website experience and uncomfortable trains."
873,Eurostar Shambles!!,Worst customer service EVER. The company is obviously managed by a bunch of intellectually challenged people.
874,Seating fiasco on Standard Premier. Not worth it!,Terrible. Paid extra for Standard Premier for family table. Seated separately with my daughter in little cabin with no window. No effort to reseat and and no compensation. Basically you pay 50% more to sit separately.
875,Terrible untrustworthy company who do not honour there word,Travelled recently from London to Paris. Long story short there was a glitch with the system reading my wife's visa (no fault of ours). It would take overnight to resolve the visa issue due to the embassy being on public holiday. As a result the boarder security assured us Eurostar would transfer the ticket. Boarder security took us to the Eurostar desk in which they stated they would transfer the ticket after ping ponging us between multiple staff members. They said they would transfer once the visa issue had been resolved first. The visa issue was rectified overnight as expected and upon returning the next day Eurostar staff refused to honour there word. The treatment and attitude from the desk was the worst I've ever experienced. With my wife in tears they forced us to pay for a new ticket forfeiting our old one. The initial ticket was around 100 pounds for 2 people one way. The man at the counter with a big smug smile requests 395 pound for the new tickets knowing we had no other choice as we'd already spent a fortune in lost accomodation and additional hotel for the night. Absolutely disgusting company. I contacted the Eurostar help online thinking they would be appalled by this staff members attitude and honour the initial agreement but no this company are scum all the way from the top to bottom. Consider this a strong warning DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! FLY SWIM WALK BUT AVOID EUROSTAR AT ALL COSTS!
876,Appalling Website and Rip off Loyalty …,Appalling Website and Rip off Loyalty schemes.  No customer focus
877,Eurostar - Can't think of anything worse...,"Eurostar is probably the worst traveling experience. Not only those idiots managed to replace old trains with newer ones that offer less comfort, less space and terrible design. Eurostar now has a new scam in place. If you arrive less than 30min before departure, say 28 minutes before the train as it's what happened to me today, they will charge £30 to change your tickets. Obviously they charge for credit card fees on top. It used to be that they would offer some flexibility but they've now realised that their monopoly allowed them to just charge for whatever they pleased. The staff is untrained and odious. My 7-months pregnant wife could explain as much as she wanted that the reason for her 2-minutes tardiness was due to the fact that she was carrying a baby and she could not walk fast but that obviously did not matter. The waiting spaces are nasty and can only remain that way as no cleaning staff can be seen.  On top of that, their trains are most often late and sometimes from personal experience they will put you in the next train when they can't handle their check-in properly. Having no direct competitor, they obviously overcharge all their passengers as my roundtrip for two has now cost me close to £600. Overall I cannot really see any positive for this poorly managed enterprise. I just can't wait for a competitor to arrive. In the meantime, besides telling the world how useless Eurostar is, I feel  powerless."
878,i have a life threatening nut allergy,i have a life threatening nut allergy . i thought selling of peanuts on transport would be a thing of the past since even airborne nuts smell can make me vomit . Why sell peanuts . There are so many sufferers out there . Choose another snack that isn't life threatening for some please .
879,Totally unacceptable,"Totally unacceptable, i have emailed Eurostar twice in past 2 weeks and rang them. No response from email and no answer on the telephone.  I have a serious complaint about extremely noisy and disruptive behaviour on their train... to make about my journey back from Brussels to London.  Very poor indeed.  UPDATE, after a public response on here from Eurostar themselves, informing me they will be in contact shortly...STILL NOT A WORD FROM THEM."
880,I'm furious!,I'm furious!
881,NO Customer Service! Appalling!,"The customer service is absolutely appalling! Cistoner Service simply do not respond to the phone calls, every time holding between 30-60 minutes before giving up."
882,Honesty not the best policy,We recently travelled to Paris with my mum for her 70th birthday. She was visiting from South Africa. When my husband booked the tickets he mistakenly booked them all in our family name. When I printed the tickets I discovered the fault and phoned to try recipe the situation. I had to book a new ticket at twice the price. No effort to make it easier . An absolute rip off! To make it worse my honesty was necessary as no one ever checks the name on a ticket with your passport.
883,On 16th September I was booked to go …,"On 16th September I was booked to go from London to Brussels on eurostar.- 1week before travelling  I hurt my back so,at 76 years of age decided I had better book assisted travel."
884,worst experience ever on the phone,"worst experience ever on the phone. Spoke to an agent called Zin. I regretted why i am actually using this service. ?After spending 30 mins on the phone, he first told me sorry you got the wrong department even thought i got the number from an another agent . after i told him it is impossible it start to say well depends i can help you on this and that. So rude and never had such a bad service ever."
885,Never again,"The online booking site brought back no results for London to Avignon 3 times.  Phone lines very busy so booked online via Gare Du Nord, The from Gare Du Lyon to Avignon and returns."
886,Bad service,Bad service. Travel with your friends isn't possible because smart marketeers drive the prices when you book for +3 people.
887,Terrible customer service,"Having traveled with Eurostar for more than 5 years, their customer service has badly worsen over the years."
888,They don't care about customers! Why would they its a monopoly!,I have to travel with Eurostar because I am French and work in London so I have have more than 10 years experience in taking the Eurostar at least monthly. THEY HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!
889,This is the worst customer service …,"This is the worst customer service based company ever only interested in your money not your needs,not sour grapes just sick that I had no option but to pay extra €480 for a train when they ( eurostar) said I had plenty of time to catch a connecting tgv they booked.  even when one of the party was 73 not a marathon runner 4 other adults cases and being put on last carriage of train and along with the hundreds of other people leaving the train trying to go places don't believe them when they say you have 50 min till your other connection plenty time they know how busy it is they book it for you remember but when you miss the tgv it's your fault they were busy worst company ever do yourself a favour fly, first and last they don't care really don't care personally think they and the tgv are in it together to well rehearsed it's obviously not there first time they have shafted someone seriously stay clear fly or drive I do it all the time fancied a change mmm guess what I'm in charge now of my holiday not some company out to ruin it"
890,It all started so well ....,"Very enjoyable journey from London - Paris. The check-in was smooth, the waiting time short, the train modern and very comfortable. The return journey was the complete opposite for a number of reasons. First, the waiting area at Gare Du Nord was overcrowded, uncomfortable and all-round poorly designed. Second, 10 minutes before boarding time we received an announcement that we had to evacuate the waiting area designated for London-bound passengers. What followed was nothing short of chaotic and distressing (particularly in the current political climate) - little direction from the staff present led to hordes of confused and anxious travellers going in all directions, knowing that they have to evacuate but not knowing how and where to."
891,There is always light at the end of a tunnel,"Shame Eurostar seems to have a bad rep, but nothing can be better than the experience of booking over the phone. This gentleman was fantastic. I was booking a trip to Lyon and he knew the city so well, giving me tips while completing the booking. What a great experience. Also was able to warn me of engineering works that were happening which allowed me to change my mind on dates (online didn't mention this). Additionally how the passport control works on the way back (apparently need to get off the train somewhere on the way and get the passport checked and get back on board). Wish I got his name - legend."
892,Traveled back from Paris to Ashford …,Travelled back from Paris to Ashford Kent on 6 August 2017 on ES9045.
893,Avoid by all means,"A horrible service, extremely expensive and operated and designed with the worst possible way to rip off the passenger/client."
894,Traumatised,Traumatised
895,Good old bad customer service,"Purchased an interrail global pass for the both of us, having realised you can now use interrail on Eurostar, so I decided to look into booking some reduced price tickets, only to realise you need to call the customer service line and book with an agent, which i thought was a bit 1994. They don't pick up the phone after being on hold for several hours over a 3 day period. I decided to book tickets at the full price as i could'nt get to an agent to book me on with interrail discount. I eventually got hold of someone who I thought was rather cold and abrupt when i asked her to refund me my tickets and rebook me with my interrail pass discount, she would'nt help me out whatsoever, even though i had said i could'nt get hold of anyone as i was on hold for hours over 3 days.  Shocking customer service, but i suppose when a company has the monopoly of running international rail services, customer service does'nt come into it. In my experience, when everything works on Eurostar, its a pleasure. But when it goes wrong, the old chesnut of bad customer service rears its head. I remember a few years ago, we slowed down at Dollands Moor and stopped just outside the channel tunnel for 75 minutes, with no explanation given for the delay. We are not idiots, tell us there is a failed train infront of us or a points failure."
896,"Fly, swim, drive or just don't go","the website is misleading and claims the tickets you wanted are no longer available after a lengthy purchasing process, I have periodically  checked said tickets availability and low and behold they are there a week later. I am down £100 and will probably have to pay more in rebooking fees. Polite questions and complaints are dealt with in a brick wall manor, Eurostar has your money and no longer wants to have anything to do with you."
897,Welcome back to the 1990's,"When we booked our first ever trip and seats on the Eurostar, we didn't know that it was a theme park ride. Honestly it was so nostalgic to revisit how things were in the 1990's. when power outlets were considered an optional extra for the rich and famous, when wifi was a pipe dream for science fiction buffs and when brown and grey seat coverings were seen as minimally futuristic. The customer service and helpfulness also hark back to the last century. Was really looking forward to this trip the next time I go to Disneyland Paris, might try a steam boat instead."
898,Don't understand the bad reviews,"I've traveled aboard Eurostar between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and I found it convenient and comfortable. It's about as cheap as flying into Stansted, but you end up at St. Pancras, not an hour+ away from London. Haven't had a bad experience with Eurostar and look forward to travel with them again."
899,What are people on about? I loooove Eurostar!,"I used to work in London and return to my family in Holland a few times a month. There is nothing like the Eurostar. For the same price as a ticket from Stansted, you get to travel straight from St Pancras to central Brussels. The only suggestion I have is to cooperate with Thalys to have one integrated service to the Netherlands. Right now, with all the high speed rail issues we've experienced in the Benelux, it is a right pain to have to change to a slow train from Brussels to the Netherlands. I spend as much time on the Brussels to Holland train as on the Eurostar, despite living on the Dutch-Belgian border (less than an hour by car). That's a true pity. I know you're not the same company, but at least you could start a joint venture for a combines Thalys-Eurostar service!"
900,Problem in tunnel very badly handled,"My train leaving Paris at 19:01 was cancelled because of problems in the Channel tunnel. When I arrived at Gare du Nord, the Eurostar area was closed off and very little information available. After 10 or 15 minutes, a woman came out and told us there were no more trains that day and they had no ability to help us at the station. She asked us to leave the station and use the website to rebook."
901,Will use alternative ways of getting to France in future,I have sent three complaints to this company. Not one response.
902,Not what we paid for,"I travelled today with my daughter on the 18.04 out of St Pancras to Brussels.  The trip was arranged for my birthday present and my first experience of Eurostar. We were seated in coach 008 seats 43 and 44. My daughter paid for a meal and a standard premier seat.  The train operatives commenced serving food.  They stopped at the seat in from of us.  The operative apologised and said he was off to replenish his trolley. Unfortunately when his trolley was replenished he commenced serving from the rear of our carriage and ran out AGAIN when he reached us.   I would also point out that we appeared to be the only 2 people travelling together.  He apologised profusely and he and a female colleague went in search of our meal. Sadly to no avail.  We were then offered something from the on board cafe. We went to look at the menu and we're disappointed to see bread, bread, bread, wraps and again bread !!!!! Exactly what we wanted to avoid.  Full marks to the operative he tried to reassure us that the food from the cafe cost Eurostar much more than the salmon we might have had. He did try to lighten the load but bottles of wine where not what we wanted or expected. Eurostar you need to up your game. Potential travellers be aware you could pay £100'for toasted sandwiches for 2 and wine.  Happy Birthday NOT."
903,Do Not Do Business with this Company,"Eurostar is dishonest. They will rip you off.  You will pay for a ticket, then find out that eurostar charged you a grossly higher price.  When I went back, after this discovery, on the subway, I literally got off the train, and took the subway back moments later, the same day."
904,Old cramped expensive trains,"Eurostar is incredibly expensive for what are horrible trains. I'm 6'6"" and I do not fit in the seats, I cannot get my legs in, they are either wedged on the seat back or I have to sit sideways with my legs in the aisle. If I sit at a table and there is someone opposite my legs go nearly to the opposite seat so they best get used to my knee in their crutch. French TGV trains are newer and far better. Eurostar seats are threadbare, ripped and the entire train should be scrapped."
905,Scoundrels! £135 to get on a LATER train!!!!,"So I'm going to France in a few days. I wanted to change my 7:55am train to a 9:17am train as I've found out that I won't be able to check into my accommodation till 4pm in Fontainebleau. So I tried to change tickets online and I was quoted £135 - oh and there is a credit card fee. If you try to call them to change tickets it's a £10 fee + credit card fee + £135. What a disgusting exchange policy. Even worse than easyjet and Ryanair! Next time I'm taking the ferry. Eurostar have lost my faith and custom. It is unjustifiable to charge so much to change tickets. £10 okay, but £135?!?! Does Eurostar think money grows on trees?"
906,Day light robbery,"I bought tickets for me and my daughter to Brussels, but I can't go due to recovering from the surgery (post ticket booking and unforeseeable). They will not refund but offered me a change of date!! Great I thought take my daughter away for a couple of days at Xmas as our summer holidays have had to be cancelled!!  After changing the dates, they then asked me to pay £149 in admin charges to change the tickets!!"
907,bet on your arrival times. scamming refunds,I traveled 4 or 5 times this year with eurostar.
908,Over hyped and pathetic customer service,I travelled from London to Brussels and the service was horrible in Standard Premier with rude on board staff. Not to mention the mismanaged boarding procedures at St. Pancras where the train arrives on the platform just 5 mins before departure.  Next time I will take a plane or try the Dutch Flyer service instead. Definitely avoid this option.
909,i got scammed by Eurostar,"Eurostar make you pay hidden fees such as a 40euros ""late arrival fees"" if you arrive less than 30min in advance. They are losing money and try to make up for it by stealing from their own customers."
910,Poor Performance!!!,I have used your Eurostar service from London to Paris on Friday July 8th at 14:01. This service was heavily delayed by one hour. This caused me a lot of problems and in the end was unable to enjoy my trip due to the lateness of my arrival.
911,This company is simply unable to handle any disruption!!,On the 30th of May. I was left stranded in Paris at 10.45pm by the cancellation of my eurostar scheduled at 9.01pm  after 3.5 hours queuing in total chaos.
912,Huge queues at Brussels; departed late; old fraying trains; no cards at buffet,A shabby service from Brussels to London yesterday.
913,"Easy to book, but limited options via app. Excellent journey!","I haven't used Eurostar yet but the ease of booking is incredibly easy. I booked my trip to Paris via the Eurostar app and it was booked within a minute, however - you can only book a train from London in the UK, I don't live in London so I had to book another train ticket separately or go onto the desktop website to book it from Birmingham (which to me - seems counterproductive as what's the point in having the app?) so on a whole, the UX on the app is good if you're living in London but anywhere else in the UK? Not so much..."
914,Using the Recent Tragic Events in Brussels for Commercial Gain,Beware this is not an honest company!
915,Don't like the new trains,"I have traveled back from France a few weeks ago.. and it was a new train which I thought cool it is going to be more comfortable.. but apart the nicer look and more space for my long legs.. It is not comfortable at all.. I miss the heat things on the side that really help you to sleep in peace, the seats are hard and to be honest I prefer the older ones."
916,Appalling,"Useless, arrogant, rude, aggressive staff with a sense of ""entitlement"" - not that you (or I), the customer, would be entitled to anything, just to follow orders. They don't even deserve the 1 star I am forced to give them."
917,Terrible UX,Awful UX. Shocking for such s big company. The website needs a complete overhaul.
918,Timetable change,"Before the timetable change, my fare up to London was £28. Now when I try to buy my ticket online, for the same time train, they want to charge me £67.  I am fortunate enough to know that the increase is down to Southern thinking the best way to get from East Croydon to West Croydon at that time is via Clapham Junction. I know I can still buy my £28 ticket, and walk from East to West (or tram if its raining) but I bet there are people who buy the expensive one because they don't realise."
919,Southern is a joke of a service,"Southern is a joke of a service which owes me so much of my money and time back. I don’t claim the money back because it’s such an onerous process and I try to avoid trains. It’s the worst thing in England today. The trains are cancelled, delayed, rescheduled and always a mess."
920,Royal Britainnia,Royal Britainnia! Oh how we are the envy of the world. It’s a privilege to be subjected to daily abuse at a premium by our lovely cattle farmers southern rail herded into their state of the art bullet trains like little sheep being sent to their slaughter. Like sheep we are slaves to our masters ready to be picked off one by one. If only trust pilot could allow you to upload videos what joy we would all behold. Who needs S&M when you have southern rail. Great work. Going from strength to strength
921,Never written a bad review but I…,"Never written a bad review but I genuinely believe Southern hate people. The number of times they cancel services without announcement is beyond a joke, they string you along when no hope is actually coming - they must be sadists. If you can do anything to avoid them do. They owe me at least 24 hours of my life and I hope something terrible happens to Govia Thameslink."
922,Absolutely terrible,"Absolutely terrible. Trains always delayed, information given is shocking. Do yourself a favour and find a different way of getting around. These clowns should be ashamed of tuemselves. Absolutely hopeless."
923,"The train only had 4 carriages, when there should have been 8 or 12.","I caught the train First Class from London to Brighton. Right outside my compartment was extremely busy and people were blocking all the exits which is a SAFETY ISSUE. There ought to be capacity limits for fire safety - so if there is a fire, people can get out safely! And the train only had 4 carriages, when there should have been 8 or 12."
924,NEVER EVER PAY FOR A TICKET BEFOREHAND.,NEVER EVER PAY FOR A TICKET BEFOREHAND.
925,An american relative came by train to…,"An american relative came by train to Uckfield, and described her journey as being rather like that you'd expect in a third world country (she's well travelled). She was told she'd have to take a train to Tunbridge Wells where a bus would be provided. Not knowing this, my partner went to Uckfield station to pick her up, and was perplexed when a train rolled in, then shortly afterwards, a coach with her cousin on it!"
926,Is Southern Reliable?,"Is Southern reliable? You can view it in two ways.  For the once a week 20 min journey I take it hasn't been on time once this year (as at mid April). I almost cried with joy when it was only 2 mins late once last month. On the other hand, if you allow an extra hour for your journey, you will almost certainly get there on time. And there's always the bonus of picking up heavily delayed previous trains."
927,Practically free,Catching for 4 years stopped a few months back but one thing I can tell you is you don't have to buy tickets!! Of course it's illegal however in my experience (4 years) they don't fine you as long as if they catch you you buy a ticket. So just bring a fiver and you'll be fine
928,DO NOT USE,"This is the worst railway probably in the whole of britain it is never on time, or even completely cancelled, even when the trains come they are completely uncomfortable and usually without air conditioning, any journey with southern is comparable to torture, i recommend considering walking before buying a ticket with southern, youll probably be there earier anyway, just AVOID AT ANY COST"
929,Never prepay for tickets ever,"Prepaid for train tickets to the airport, cost £29... trains were cancelled, had to get a taxi to the airport as was going to miss my flight and southern rail offer me a whole £7.30 back."
930,NEVER failed to make me late,"NEVER failed to make me late, appalling services"
931,Worst management ever,"Worst management ever. Stress caused by Southern each morning each afternoon for nearly 10 years, there hasn’t been a day without a delay. Southern Boss, you are a mean horrible person."
932,Had a trip from Eastbourne to London,"Had a trip from Eastbourne to London. Cancelled last minute, had to take a bus to Lewis. Got to Lewis to find out no further trains go from there at all until 10 mins later they decided they will run a train to Brighton. Took that train and whilst on it an announcement was made that this train wiould actually go to London Victoria (yey!) only to find out in Brighton that they changed their mind and I had to change in Brighton."
933,Embarrassment to the country and in…,"Embarrassment to the country and in general to train travel. Incredibly after living in the UK for 4 months,  trains have been cancelled 7 times,  late by more than 10 mins around 8 times and there have been replacement buses due to ""engineering works"" on every single weekend I have travelled between Eastbourne and London. I have been sitting in such a replacement bus for 30mins now just parked at lewes while the staff laugh and smoke outside. No information from the railway when we will leave or why we are waiting. No markings on where to get the bus from (we obviously know because we have had to use them so often) Worst train company I've used and that's in multiple countries including apparently ""3rd World countries""."
934,Southern don't deserve even 1 star,Southern don't deserve 1 star. They can't run their service. Cut staff. Make huge profits at the expense of the customer and taxpayer.  I've lost count of the number of times my train from London Victoria has beeem cancelled and I wait half an hour. How can you not run your own timetable?
935,Absolutely atrocious company,"Absolutely atrocious company, holds passengers in utter contempt, constantly late, constant stop-skipping, ultimately run only for profit and not for the customer, rude staff, dilapidated stations, just a mess."
936,Living the dream!,"Please appreciate most (not all) of the positive feedback has been put here by SouthernRail in a poor attempt to say "" we're not that bad"". Yes you are southernsnail, your OBS clearly don't give a damn about passengers and help make you a total disgrace."
937,This company is horrendous,"This company is horrendous, you know it and I know it. An hour late for work again today, my train should only take 30 minutes!"
938,Never on time,"Never on time. Always overcrowded. No AC. Trains are sooo hot and smelly , it's outrageous!!"
939,How are they still holding franchise?!,How are they still holding this franchise and is anyone getting paid to “operate” this “service”?! Outrageously awful in every possible way I cannot believe they can charge for the mess they have created.

941,"Shocking Service, Total Shambles","Its an ongoing saga, but I can genuinely say that every journey each day I have made in the last two weeks in and out of rush hour has had delays, cancellations, overcrowding etc etc.... not once can I remember a train on time."
942,Food Service was Excellent...Varavel…,Food Service was Excellent...Varavel Express
943,Absolutely the worst service,"Absolutely the worst service. I just came back to London from working abroad for 5 years. Nothing has changed before I left. Delays, cancellations, and running are going to be part of your commuting life."

Every time !! . it is incomprehensible that this shambles still have their franchise , someone somewhere must be getting a big pay off .  They have zero consideration for the pain they put their customers through . I have lost count of the amount of times my train has been delayed or cancelled causing a huge backlog of commuters then when a train finally arrives late with not enough carriages the overcrowding is of biblical proportions and surely extremely dangerous . the amount of times a train has crawled along at walking speed . I could go on and on . people I know from Haywards Heath area have actually either quit their jobs  or moved to avoid using this hideous joke of a train service , yes it's that bad. there are only so many times you can be late for work / meetings . i myself leave an hour early to allow time for their shoddy service but still am regularly late for whatever I have to do . This company is ruining peoples lives !!!"
946,"Flea ridden, dirty trains that never run on time, if at all....","I use Southern Rail every day to get to work, or not as the case is often."
947,Don’t waste your money on this complete…,"Don’t waste your money on this complete shambles of a company. Use any other mode of transport, even walk, as I guarantee you will get to your destination quicker, for less money and have a far more pleasant experience."
948,Youre a disgrace,Bus replacement from Bexhill to Eastbourne (again). Old bus with non-functional ac and seats with so little leg room that I had to stand for most of the journey. 45 mins vs normal 20mins. Sick and tired of this BS. Govt should mandate a 50% discount on the ticket if forced to take a bus.
949,Had to go to West Croydon from London…,Had to go to West Croydon from London Bridge and used Southern Railway for the first time. Nice clean trains inside and out and the trains left and arrived on time. Plenty of platform staff available who were very polite and helpful in asking my destination and directing me to the correct platform whilst giving the time of the next available train. There were no guards in sight but I felt safe and relaxed during my journeys.
950,Let down once again by this substandard operator,"Let down once again by this sub standard operator, they can just cancel trains as they please and treat their customers as idiots by not even explaining their actions. Appalling customer service, I will never use this company again after repeated failures, The directors of this shambolic operator should be highly embarrassed!!!!!"
951,What a dodgy people working with train,"What a dodgy people working with train. We are paying so much money for tickets to travel, and we have to wait ages for one train. You have to sort this out."
952,Dirty trains,Southern are still running 1980's train in some major routes. Inside of this train are absolutely filthy. Seats look never been washed or cleaned. There are no toilets on those trains.
953,Always late or cancelling services.,Always late or cancelling services.
954,The worst transportation I have ever…,The worst transportation I have ever used. There is no day without delay.
955,One year with this company.. disaster for one year... expensive for the disaster service,The disaster company
956,Not wonder why this line has been voted…,"Not wonder why this line has been voted worst train line 3 years in a row. 2 min before train arriving they cancelled it, and no-one in the station give you a reason, no alternative routes, not compensation, but if you dare to send an email to complaint expect no answer."
957,Southern trains are a disgrace!,"Southern trains are a disgrace. My daughter has to go one stop to get to school. Southern has reduced the service down to one train from two and there are constant cancellations of that ONE train. Children as young as 11 are left standing at the station with no way to get to school. Also, tickets don’t work in machines leaving children stuck on unmanned stations. Southern doesn’t refund unused tickets bought in advance in London (to get round the ones that don’t work bought locally) as it’s not enough money to cover their ‘administration’ fee. I’ve never experienced such horrific service where children depend on it. I rarely give bad reviews; if you have nothing positive to say, stay silent. However, in this case Southern only gets one star because there’s no option to give zero stars!"

959,BIG thank you to the East Croydon station staff,A BIG thank you to the East Croydon station staff who was on duty on 30 Dec at around 5-6pm at the counter nearest to the platform!!
960,Do unto others as you expect unto you.,"My Daughter who is a nurse has frequently had to rely upon her mother to get her to work because the staff at Southern are not,the journey is an hour out of my wife’s busy schedule who is also a nurse."
961,Overcrowded train with no where to put  …,"Overcrowded train with no where to put  large travelling luggage,  no basics such as wifi or charging points.  Train normally late or cancelled.  Much quicker to take a car"
962,Who could give Southern more than one star?!!!  Not a regular user.,"I find it incredible that there are any reviews here that are not at the minimum stars.  Like many others, I wish I could give negative stars."
963,train was on time and got a seat,"train was on time and got a seat, prompt service"
964,Unbelievable....once again late train …,Unbelievable....once again late train to caterham...  driver then says good evening passengers sorry for the late running of this train to carsharlton.. wouldnt be so bad but sent everyone in to panic.. as it was 2.50pm (afternoon) and the train was for caterham.. when will southern sort out their shabby poorly run business and start giving passengers a reliable service... come on people sort it out u cause so much stress its not fair
965,Southern small knob,"I don’t think you could find a company that is run by a more useless bunch of theiving, unorganised, bimbos. I hope the owner and managers of southern read this and know I and many other commuters think you’re a knob, and a small one at that."
966,Minus 1 Star,"This may look like a 1 star review but it's actually a minus 1 star review. Even when the trains aren't cancelled, they are grossly overcrowded and late. I also haven't even seen a guard on the train for over a week, so the striking was really worth it. Their twitter is also pointless, they only answer the questions that don't make them look really bad...which is most of them and issue multiple meaningless apologies which arent backed up by action. If they were working in any other industry, they would have been removed along long time ago."
967,It is impossible to imagine a poorer …,"It is impossible to imagine a poorer service than that currently operated by Southern. I have now given up on using the train as one can never be sure of arriving in London on time for business meetings or being able to get home to Eastbourne in the evenings. The sheer number of “Cancelled” services, inexplicably diverted services, replacement bus services, or lame excuses over unavailable staff, signal or points failures, is now beyond belief and entirely unacceptable. This week, a person was apparently “taken ill” on a train at Clapham, which effectively resulted in cancelled or delayed services across the whole Southern network. Why was this person not just removed from the train? Why did it have to interrupt the travel plans of countless thousands of commuters? Given the number of people travelling on the network it is obvious that by the law of averages someone will occasionally be taken ill. But why should it adversely affect so many other services? I have now decided never to use Southern again but to drive everywhere in future. The roads are already congested but it is cheaper and one is still more confident of getting to and fro between the capital and the Coast on time to conduct one’s working life. It’s a shameful, catastrophically poor service and an indisputable argument for re-nationalisation, or the removal of Southern’s franchise. Only that, or the sacking of the entire management, is likely to lead to the necessary improvements to what is an almost laughably abysmal service."
968,Never fail to disappoint,"Never fail to disappoint! Absolute joke of a service, you would think you have downgraded in life with the lack of care received from the journey.  Cancellation, delay, wrong announcements, wrong platforms! Heard it all with Southern Railway - not sure how they get away with it?"
969,The worst train services that ever …,The worst train services that ever existed!!!
970,Worst train company ever,Trains are late EVERY day or cancelled!!! It is a nightmare... Every day another excuse to explain why the service is delayed... 😤😤😤😤😤😤
971,Been adding up the total amount of time …,Been adding up the total amount of time Southerns delays/cancellations have cost me on my commute to/from work. In the past 5 working days alone it's been 68 minutes...
972,Would rather stick pins in my eyes,"I honestly cannot qualify or quantify quite how angry this company makes me, I often describe it as being the only rail company in the world that have never seen a train. It's like they don't even understand the prospect of it."
973,Always a nightmare,Always a nightmare. I don't really get whats is behind all these problems but for sure it is way bigger than what it seems or what is being published on the media.
974,I encourage customers to fight back,I encourage customers to fight back!
975,Worst public transport in the UK,"Worst public transport in the UK. They are extremely expensive, example... £11.20 on the train, costs me £0.90 in the car. When you're paying between £50,000 and £70,000 to drivers to ""drive"" something they don't even need to steer, then it's no wonder the fares are expensive. Constant strikes, regarding guards wanting to push a button, reminds me of toddlers not getting their own way, ""Let me push it daddy"", all under the guise of health and safety, they think the public are stupid!"
976,Routinely dreadful service.,Routinely dreadful service.
977,Worst train company ever,"Absolutely appalling service. My train has been late everyday for 18 months!!!! Totally unreliable service trains often skip my station to make up time as so delayed. cant run a proper service and very expensive, absolute joke!!"
978,Dreadful Service or lack of.,Dreadful Service or lack of.
979,The worst rail company in existence.,The worst rail company in existence.
980,"Southern- time to act ""you're fired! """,It's about time that Southern take a firm stance and get ride of these highly paid incompetent fools that want to strike at every opportunity. There are people trying to earn an honest  a living and  getting into work or home without being frustrated is the least we can ask for. Alternatively hand this route over to a company that's willing to tackle these challenges head on like Virgin. Why not consider Automation/ Robotics to get commuters from A to B.
981,Southern are a disgrace,Southern are a disgrace. We have just sat on the platform for 15 minutes CV waiting for a driver then they cancelled the train to Ore and sent it back to London. Why. This company still has the franchise is a mystery.
982,Words can't describe Southern Rail,"I have never experienced such an incompetent company. Strikes have been going on for 2 years now affecting passengers on a daily basis. Seriously, sort your s**t out between your staff, company and unions and don't affect customers with your staff members disputes. Grrrrrr"
983,I have been very disappointed with …,I have been very disappointed with Southern Railway. After so many delays and cancelations last year I was not approved for compensation due to the severe levels of disruption experienced in 2016. I hold more than 12 weeks worth of seasonal ticket between April - December but I never received any compensation although I had a bad experience when travelling with Southern Railway service.
984,What a joke this morning train delayed …,What a joke this morning train delayed for 20 minutes and late for a meeting
985,Useless useless useless,Where to start with this pathetic excuse for a company trains always late and overcrowded. the overcrowding is caused by the delays. trains dirty and smelly. Just when you think they cant get any worse they install new ticket machines that work one day in five and when they do work they take money without giving tickets.
986,Southern railway are without doubt the worst ever,"Southern railway are without doubt the most unreliable railway I have ever travelled. How can such a crucial connection be so poor. On direct trains it is never on time and often simply cancels for no good reason given loads of other lines seem to run. But on trains where I need it to connect to another train is where i notice how bad it is. Even when the trainline app tells me to take Southern onto another line, allowing a 5 minute changeover, 3 out of the 4 times it is more than 5 mins late and my entire journey is completely screwed. Complete incompetence and lack of care for customers"
987,The conducter,"The conducter, Jowel was a hero on the Horsham train to Victoria."
988,Absolutely terrible service,Absolutely terrible service. I commute daily using Southern and delays of up to 10 minutes can be considered completely normal. Trains can end up sitting on a platform for 3-5 minutes for no good reason.  I used to use South West Trains daily and that was a luxury compared to Southern.  I begrudge paying extortionate amounts of money for the service I'm getting.
989,Bus replacement service shambles,This is a zero or minus star rating not one star.
990,Never got re-funded for a delayed train,"Never got re-funded for a train delayed for over an hour, which is in their policy. No customer service, still trying over a month later to receive money, only for them to repeatedly dodge responsibility or tell me they will contact me later with no response. Very poor service and obviously do not want to fulfill their own policies"
991,An utterly despicable organisation.,An utterly despicable organisation.
992,Poor Service,"Every time I travel with Southern the trains are delayed or cancelled with various excuses. Overall a very poor service, with very little focus on the customers. Having travelled on other train networks I know it is possible to achieve a reliable service."
993,Southern Rail are a joke,"Southern Rail are the worst railway company in London without a doubt. Their trains never run on time, I have no idea what percentage of their trains are just cancelled, but I can assure you it's a lot! They take far longer than usual to get anywhere, they travel at snails pace. Overall they are very unreliable, if your planning a trip with southern rail you may need to add hours onto your journey."
994,Perfect service - May 31st 2017,I had a great service on Friday 31st May - I was travelling from Gatwick to Polegate late evening and had heavy bags. A male ticket inspector helped me with my bags and helped me to move to a different carriage. He was very courteous and I just want to say thank you for a great service!!
995,Please someone else take over the company,"Very ironic that we have all these strikes for driver fearing losing there job, but the trains from Streatham hill seem to be cancelled due to lack of drivers?! Doesn't seem to make sense. Southern do not know what they are doing!"
996,Very bad service,"Simple trip from Horsham to Portsmouth turned into a nightmare. Train came late and then halfway through the journey it got cancelled all together. Turfed off at a station in the middle of nowhere and then another change required to get where we were going. Coming home train late and then terminated at Horsham, sorry to those hoping to get to Victoria. Poor service, I feel sorry for those that have to use Southern Rail regularly."
997,Delay repayment system sucks,"So it is okay for your train to be 15-20 mins late and you claim delay repayment fare costing 3.90 and you get back £1 beyond a joke, complete waste of time in putting in your request if that is what you get!!"
998,Got me from A to B on time,The price seemed ok for the journey I made.
999,You should have a nil star rating.,You should have a nil star rating.

1003,Terrible,"Terrible. Too many strikes, too few services, too expensive, bad service, overcrowded trains and I could go on."
1004,That's the worst service ever,"That's the worst service ever, always cancellations or delays. This morning cancelled 2 trains from Milton Keynes.  I'm paying monthly over £300 for cancelled trains!"

1006,Terrible Southern Rail website,Terrible Southern Rail website
1007,Rubbish service,"Rubbish service.  Cancellations in the my last 3 journeys within 3 days!!!! Worst...last minutes announcements for cancellations due to ""no crew members""!!!!! This is announced 1 minute before train time!!!!!!!!"
1008,Beyond rubbish,"Beyond rubbish. They don't care - they have your money and are laughing. Delays on most trains, Information drip fed minute by minute so you can't make a decision to use another service, then changed whilst you are on the train so it terminates early, totally before my station. Then cancelled, causing huge frustration to hundreds of passengers on the platform. And they don't refund. Ever."
1009,Every time I have used this company the …,Every time I have used this company the train has been cancelled today they have out done themselves not one train cancelled but 4 and another two delayed excuses ranged to a broken down train and even saying they couldn't find the train driver for the train in this day and age you would think the driver would of had a mobile phone but I guess not so the trains that did come were packed with 4 trains worth of passengers stood on an over crowded train for over an hour and I'm disabled and couldn't get a seat
1010,Why oooohh why???,Why oooohh why???? 1 hour journey home comes to 1 hour and still not even half way!!! Constant changes of information on the platform at east croydon!! Will miss my conneting change which by the way will have to make me wait another 30minutes before another one! At the end it will take me over 2 HOURS AND 20MINUTES PLUS (or 10minutes less if i take a taxi thanks a lot) to get home you bunch of useless thefts!
1011,Zero or misleading info,"Due to no info in Old Street, and misleading info from personnel, I used my oyster to tap in taking a train. Tapping out I discovered I could only buy a ticket, not tapping. I voluntarily offered to buy a ticket and pay the difference, but got directed to an ""inspector"", who formalized a fine."
1012,______________just no.,______________just no.
1013,Shocking service,"Shocking service. Cancelled trains, delays, wrong information. Your service is the worst I have ever experienced. A 1.5 hour journey has turned into a 2.5  hour disgrace and we're still not even half way home. You need to lose your franchise and be re-nationalised."
1014,Terrible service today back from the …Poor service,Terrible service today back from the Eastbourne Airshow
1015,at least 2 daily cancellations on one route,There are at least 2 daily cancellations on my route. Meaning I'm paying full whack for a lesser service. Plus trains regularly shut doors early and your cant get on at the advertised time of departure with the excuse they leave 30 seconds before. Absolutely rubbish the doors close long before this.
1016,Thank you,"I would like to say a big thank you, to Steven who works at New Eltham station for tracking my handbag which i had left on the train last Wednesday evening! My bag was found within two days and all my personal belongings were still there."
1017,the ongoing issue with the …,"the ongoing issue with the miscommunication of the train service is never clearly disseminated, the staff are ok when it works but when there is disruption or strike action like there has been for a long time they have always given me the wrong information, it is like trying to get blood out of a stone."
1018,Outrageous,You care NOTHING for the health & safety of your passengers.
1019,wow so bad,never use again
1020,"""Gatwick Express"" trains that don't stop there!!","On the 18:30 train to Brighton from London Victoria which the scrolling digital indicator calls the ""Gatwick Express"" - except it doesn't actually stop there and there was no guard/ driver announcement to tell people not to believe the indicator. So a party of foreign tourists who were stupid enough to believe what they read have been let down by Southern Fail and are likely to miss their flights.  You couldn't make up their incompetance. On top of their usual dismal performance on non-strike days."
1021,Dreadful.,Delayed. Slow. Inconsistent. Indifferent. Constantly overtaken by more efficient more rapid alternative train operators ie South Western rail/Gatwick Express etc. The unforgivable ongoing issues between company and unions have no effect on attitude towards customers. The whole operation should be disenfranchised and the operation put out afresh to tender
1022,Patience exhausted,"Have been a regular rail commuter from Sussex to London for over 35 years: British Rail Network Southeast/SouthCentral, Connex and now Southern Fail. The service was bad. It is now worse, and deteriorating. I didn't believe it was possible, but it is getting progressively worse than bl**dy awful. I am starting to look for a job outside London so that I can shake the dust of this benighted dung-heap from my shoes forever. I can't begin to describe the anger and disgust I feel towards the whole shower of them, management, unions et al. May they all rot in the festering cesspit of their own making."
1023,Worst company in the world,I've given up. Left my job
1024,delays and cancelled a whole service,im from worthing and i go to northampton to see my girlfriend a lot and they cancelled all the milton keynes trains from clapham and i have to use the overground which took forever. i would like to see southern go to northampton because its a popular station from people that go between milton keynes and northampton
1025,Don't use them if you can avoid it,Totally unreliable.  I use alternative public transport whenever humanly possible.  They should have been disenfranchised by the Government by now.
1026,Most vile company,Southern rail actually makes me feel sick. Your trains are always late if they come at all !! They take hours longer than they should. the honest truth is that the idea of using your service makes me want to pull my own hair out ! Today I got a fine for not having a ticket I know all my fault as your wonder ignorant rude vile train police told me I went up and asked for help due to the ticket machine not working and the conductor being awol !!!! I went and asked can I please buy my ticket explained my predicament oh no that doesn't matter it's allllll my fault !!! Not the fault of your company oh no because your ticket machines don't work and your conductors are where ? Oh yeah on strike !!!! You have these train police cornering 3 young girls causing one to burst in to tears !! Who exactly do you think you are ? Fining people for a service that they don't even get ! How dare you. Why I'm typing this i don't know as you will probably ignore it like you do all the problems you're having. Shame on you.
1027,Run by incompetant insenstive bullies absolute disgrace,Its all been said before but I hope the management of Southern Railways get their just deserts for a total lack of an morals around safety and being prepared accept the risk of human life (the lives of their passengers) to save money. Thats all this is about - money...
1028,Worse then a 3rd war country's train service,Dear sir/ madam
1029,FIRE THE LOT OF THEM AND GET IMMIGRANTS,I HATE SOUTHERN RAIL
1030,Stop striking,I was late to my dream job interview because of the strikes and didn't get the job! I thought being a private firm they took no pay but no we the taxpayer pay there wages still! And then they have the cheeck to try and charge us more for tickets!  I will avoid the train at all costs now.
1031,I support the strikers,"I agree with the staff on strike and the drivers, yes, you do need another member of staff on a train apart from the driver. It's plain common sense and an obvious safety issue. If Southern rail can't see that, they don't deserve to run a rail company for the general public. And has been stated over and over again...train companies never have had so much money in the kitty. I suspect it's shareholders and not  passenger welfare that's the real issue here."
1032,Impressively contemptuous,"Avoid if at all possible. They will take your money, let you down and lie."
1033,Visiting long lost relatives,"I haven't seen my Dad in 12 years. I had the chance to see him in London. He was there and I wasn't. I wasn't there because there were rail strikes and I couldn't get to London. Cheers Southern. You have just won bronze, silver and gold in the morons olympics. And you have broken my heart."
1034,BOYCOTT THE TRAINS Nightmare journey now boycotting for 5 years plus,Couldn't fathom the railway boards and barely able to plan my journey after a nightmare flight with flu and sleep deprivation.
1035,Southern Rail: So Glad I Moved Away,"I commuted from Redhill for 28 years, and saw a service which just got worse every year.  The old slam door trains of British Rail days may have had their faults but generally they got to London Bridge faster than first franchise holder Notwork SouthCentral,  and very much quicker than the totally rubbish service offered by Southern.  Southern are just one big rip off company who con politicians and the travelling public with excessive fares and poor service, while their totally useless self-important managers stuff their pockets with commuters hard-earned cash and care nothing for customers.  They took over the franchise with glossy magazine slogans about 'The Renaissance of the Great British Railway' which soon turned out to be the sickest of jokes given their poor service and total lack of customer care.  They really havn't got the first idea of how to efficiently run a railway franchise and their trains on the Brighton line (and others) are now the most expensive, slowest and most unreliable in Europe - slower than the UK's golden age of steam. They have totally failed the travelling public and should be stripped of the franchise without delay.  I am so glad I sold up and moved away from Redhill as I couldn't stand their daily excuses any longer.  I can only advise long suffering commuters on Southern to take direct action to get rid of them;  to refuse to pay fares; to drive over to the nearest Southeastern network station and catch more reliable trains up to town; to car share to the nearest London tube;  and to keep doing it until the government listens (most unlikely)  or you manage to bankrupt the whole rotten company. Boycott them by campaigning for fast regular coach services, start community rail groups to get rid of them, but most of all stop buying their rip off season tickets.  They will soon start to listen when it hurts their fat pockets. Good luck to you all. Signed Very Angry of Tunbridge Wells - Kent is one hell of a great escape from the totally dreadful Southern."
1036,"If you can travel by another route, DO IT!","I try and use the trains everyday because they're usually the fastest and most convenient method of travel around me. The service i receive though is terrible, almost everyday they're delayed if not cancelled and when they are, the staff are not bothered or helpful at all. Although even though you may get terrible service and cancelled trains, they'll try and take your money from you in every single situation besides having extraordinarily high ticket prices for what poor service they offer. Such a monopolised company as no real other fast travel to get around locally whilst also travelling afar. 2/10 When the trains are on time it works OK, other than that, terrible, unacknowledged staff and sky high (and rising) ticket prices."
1037,"Awful service, sick of strikes being organised by Unions !","What an awful over priced service this company offers. I only wish everybody could strike at the drop of a hat, as these people do. Wouldn't it be nice if another industry went on strike, say shipping/transport, meaning these 'workers' couldn't do their online shopping and receive Christmas Presents, or get their groceries. The same level of inconsiderate disruption they are causing to thousands of peoples lives."
1038,They are terrible,Absolute rubish. They don't care about the people travelling at all.
1039,Worst company ever,Unfortunately my only transport work is a southern train. 2016 was the year were I was able to arrive more days late to work than on time. Southern service shouldn't be pre paid!
1040,Absolutelysh.t,The worst company ever!
1041,Appalling service,Almost missed my flight from Gatwick the other day due to cancelled trains from Clapham in morning. Now reading about a never-ending series of strikes in December. Unacceptable in this day and age. Get your act together or get out.
1042,Money grabbing c**ts.,If there was one word I could describe this service that word would be S**T. I get a train from London Victoria to Selhurst every weekday and 3 out of the 5 times I get it a week there are cancellations or delays. Never have I received any compensation or anything to contribute towards my journey cost but instead I get to where I need to be late and have to pay out for it. They should make this service free because I don't know what I'm paying for because it's definalty not the BS that I'm getting at the moment. Good luck if you need to get the service one day. Oh and also remember to turn up at least 1hr early for your train to make sure you can get the one that was delayed 1hr before yours!!!!!
1043,Travelled across Italy on Public transport but was let down in the UK by your Joke of a service,"Firstly why has this service not been taken away from you beggars belief, in most European countries you would have had thousands of people turning up at your offices with pitchforks."
1044,Suggestion,"Couldn't get a train from Victoria to East Grinstead so I had to take the last service. Its late, tough day and all I want is to go straight to bed, together with probably the rest of passengers."
1045,20 minute delays or cancelled as standard.,"These days 20 minute delays are absolutely the norm, where trains are not cancelled altogether."
1046,Train to Victoria from Horsham suddenly rerouted to London Bridge whilst in transit!,I have tried to avoid all train travel in the last couple of months. Southern have ruined so many trips in recent weeks both for work and pleasure. Today I caught the train from Horsham to Clapham to meet my son for my birthday. We set off - late of course - and the guard has just announced that we are now going to London Bridge and he didn't know. We will have to get off and change. Unbelievable.
1047,If only you could give no stars.,"Sat freezing cold on a platform yet again because of Southern Rail's incompetence. This time no information that we were delayed or why on the train and missed the connection. Now nobody at this station and limited information on the boards. I have missed countless social occasions, been late for work too many times and been stranded until late at night often, with barely just minimal abrupt information from disgruntled staff, and yet have no choice but to keep using this pitiful service. Seems to be the only place in the country that struggles with the concept of organised services quite so much. It's a joke, a nuisance and waste of everyone's time! Thanks for ruining yet another evening!"
1048,It's not just the train service it' …,"It's not just the train service it's the whole set up. Trying to obtain a refund from April 2016 where I decided not to travel due to a strike day I eventually got my refund (including some deserved compensation for the hassle) in November 2016.....seven whole months later! Most of the time they take at least 3-4 weeks to get back to you (if at all), then they lost my tickets, then my correspondence and finally emailed me addressing me by Mr. ******* , who was a member of their own staff. Laugh...you have to I guess? They should be stripped of the running of Southern.....they are simply not up to it from the top to the bottom."
1049,50/50 chance to catch a train after 20:00 pm,"If you like to play with your luck after a long and busy day after work, catching a train on Southern Railways is your best game. Was hoping to catch a train after work to go home, but instead got  two times in a row canceled trains in two days then I stopped using the crap green trains. My girlfriend got four canceled trains in a row after work yesterday and was late for two hours. Just pure random chance to go home with this railway service."
1050,Trip to Gatwick Christmas Eve,"At least some trains running but couldn't believe the state of the windows as so dirty could hardy see out... seemed like weeks of grime and so different to Southwest Trains that I use often, carriages outside always gleaming.    Seems it's not just drivers, guards unhappy even the cleaning schedule not happening."
1051,Embarrassment,"We don't care whose fault all the problems are (unions, government, staff, management, leaves, etc, etc). The bottom line is as passengers we are let down on a frequent basis. Sometimes not even able to make essential journeys to work or see family etc."
1052,If you want to be robbed look no further!,"This company is disgusting I don't even know where to start, dirty trains, toilets out of use, over crowded .... And let's not forget they never run on time!"
1053,Tunbridge 30 minute delay,Nightmare journey from Redhill to Tonbridge 30 min delay  absolute nightmare the sooner  they lose their franchise the better
1054,Horrible,"This is my second week I'm travel with them and every single day are delayed !!!!! What we pay for I want to know ?!. It normally should take me 30 min to get back home after work ,but always take me an hour ?!?!? After all taxes and expensive tickets I WANT TO BE AT HOME AFTER LONG DAY ON THE TIME .!!!! SHAME !!!My journey is normally From Clapham to Waddon ....."
1055,Absolutely DISGRACEFUL!!!,"I am now more than likely going to fail my university course. I was due to go to a tutorial and every single train was cancelled and these tutorials are held in the evening and every single train was cancelled not a single train was running!! Not even rail replacement busses so I couldn't go and because I couldn't go I didn't have the information I needed to complete my assignment and so have jeopardised my degree course. Too say I'm angry is in fact an understatement, I'm seriously considering sending in a letter of complaint and some sort of compensation as this degree course cost me £2000 for this module alone!! NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL SOUTHERN!!!!!"
1056,Incompetent,The company is so incompetent I'm surprised they're still operating.
1057,Worst UK company by far,"Pay a premium price for a truly shocking third world service. I have travelled twice a day in 2016 and only been on time three times. Cancellations, delays and dreadfully rude customer service is the norm. Avoid at all costs."
1058,Truly a shower of ****,"I would say avoid at all costs, but if you find yourself using them, sadly you probably couldn't avoid them. They take shambles and incompetence to a whole new level. Truly a parody of a train operator, a national embarrassment and disgrace. Do they care? Why would they as they rake in profit irrespective of how badly they perform. If using them, best of luck and assume your planned train will be very delayed or more likely cancelled."
1059,"Unacceptable, shocking, sad..",I moved to a new house next to a Southern Rail station 2 months ago and I have already experience last week the third three day strike..
1060,Rude customer service,"I approached her for help and she suddenly snapped at me saying ""what's your question"". she also laughed at me few times. This employee is a black british female and approximately 5 foot 10"
1061,Shocking,This service gets worse and worse. Train terminates again at another station because they are running late. Train home delayed by 30mins.
1062,"Useless company, bunch of liars and thieves.","Always late, delayed, cancelled or all of the above, their 'service' is the worst I've ever seen. I hate the fact that I don't have any faster alternative to get to work. Useless company."
1063,"Appalling service, almost daily...","Firstly, I shall make clear some facts about Southern Railway..."
1064,Beyond usless,"If you can sacrifice a pound of flesh to avoid traveling with southern, do it. They are completely and utterly incapable of delivering anything approaching a useful service. Expensive, smelly, overcrowded, delays and cancellations, all amount to a 'service' that would test even the most patient of people. If you have to be somewhere then you just simply can't rely on them, I have missed flights, plays and social events as well as being late for work countless times they have made my life miserable for months and it looks set to continue. How they can face themselves I simply don't know."
1065,Another useless experience,So last week there were no trains from Victoria to Gatwick on Sunday.. And the replacement bus to Clapham Junction took 30mins and then there were still no direct trains to Gatwick. So i missed my plane. Costing me £300.
1066,"Probably the worst, most unreliable Rail operating company in the world",Last Friday evening due to get the 17-39 train to Eastbourne Station from East Croydon Station but this was cancelled a few minutes before due. Then got the 17-44 train to Ore via Eastbourne but when it arrived late at Haywards Heath we were told that a driver to continue the journey was not available. Waited and waited then told the train would go via Brighton Station instead. Then after more delays train finally left for Brighton where the train stopped for a long time. A new conductor boarded the train but he could not speak English properly and it was almost impossible to understand what he was saying. Train arrived at destination over an hour late. Southern Rail management are entirely responsible for the disastrous unreliable service they provide. It must be hell for the train drivers and guards/conductors employed by Southern Rail to have to bear the brunt of abuse from rail users through no fault of their own. Southern Rail should be fined hundreds of millions of pounds and lose their franchise immediately.
1067,Utterly useless numpties.,"Yet again another long day at work is rewarded with a delayed and overcrowded journey home on the Uckfield line. Thanks Southern, your incompetence is noteworthy."
1068,Incompetent,It amazes me on a daily basis how this company is allowed to continue to operate.
1069,Southern Rail is crap,Not a week goes by with a service being cancelled or having to find an alternative train journey to get home.
1070,Appalling - brighton via Gatwick Southern Rail train cancelled - may miss plane,I have joined the thousands of victims whose day has been seriously spoilt  by this appalling company. Up at 4am in order to catch the 0509 to Gatwick.  Train now cancelled.  And may miss flight. A lovely start to a holiday is now a hugely stressful experience. And I sincerely hope this useless rail company is replaced by a decent provider that delivers a reliable service not a never ending series of disasters.
1071,A disaster of a company,"Got free corporate tickets to the Brighton game. I avoid using Southern Fail like I avoid penis cancer but due to wanting a drink, the tsport being included i.e. free, and it being 3 f'in stops I thought what could go wrong."
1072,Conductors should be sacked,Unbelievable number of cancellations and late trains due to conductors. The train I was on was cancelled as the conductor went missing. Disgraceful behaviour for people who feel entitled to a job rather than having a need for the role. No method of effectively complaining. No one willing to help passengers who have been feeling the pain for months.
1073,"Terrible train service, terrible company","A railway company on which one can almost always, without fail, guarantee cancellations on any given line on any given day is quite frankly not a real railway company. Southern consistently fails to deliver on its most basic operational output; getting customers from A to B within the timeframe they require."
1074,"Complete Joke, Not The Funny Kind","Conductors go on strike because they don't want their jobs to be cut or undermined, but the reality of it is that the conductors are never on time or are 'ill' meaning trains are delayed or cancelled, so what's the point in having them anyway."
1075,Rotten service!,"My 25th wedding anniversary on 7 September and months ago I booked an afternoon tea at the Savoy in London to celebrate our special day. Due to selfish strike action we have now had our very special day absolutely ruined - well done Southern Rail!!!! This is a one-off for me, as I don't use this service very often but I do feel extremely sorry for the poor commuters who have to face this rotten service every day. Selfish SR employees, holding people to ransom, charging extortionate prices and giving an absolute rubbish service!!  Shame on you!"
1076,Worst service EVER,"I moved in tunbridge wells and I'm commuting in London for work since 4 Months ago. Since then I've been always late, trains delayed every single day, morning and evening trains as well, for at least, and I repeat, AT LEAST 5/10 minutes to a max of 30/40 minutes. I got to walk fast to be at work in time and most of the times I'm late anyway!!  And all this comes with the ""cheapest""price ever, which in my case is 420 pounds pcm!!!!!! 5k per year!!! Half of a flat rent bill and 1/4 of my income!!!! And you can't even complain your money back if the train is late less than 30 minutes!!! What the hell is wrong with you!!! Get down those prices if you can't afford to run a good service!! People are paying tons of money to run your service and you repay us with delays and bad service! Someone have to do something about it!!"
1077,MPs need to get involved!!!!,"I am regularly late to work due to this service... How trains can be cancelled first thing in the morning I don't know. I've sat at harlington station for hours waiting for a train because they cancel every single one. I always check online before attempting to board this train and if it is 'on-time' I will get train train instead of driving (as its a lot quicker than battling traffic/parking) however on many occasions I am very disappointed to have no announcement and no sign of delays, just a 'missing' train... Or it will go from on time to cancelled 2 minutes before it's due to arrive because of 'missing conductors'. 1- how did they not know that earlier 2- that is no way to run a business. Today on the way home from work I arrived at the train station to see that every single southern service for every destination was delayed by a minimum of 25 minutes. I have written letters of complaint to the customer service teams and haven't even been acknowledged. Don't bother trying to get your money back because you won't.. If you can avoid this service please do"
1078,unbelievably bad,words fail me
1079,Awful,Worst train company ever.
1080,"Abject misery, A national scandal",Abject misery is all I can say without swearing!  I live on the coast and have no alternative to getting to London. People are giving up their jobs for the sake of sanity. For this to be happening in GB in 2016 is a monumental scandal and a national disgrace. I dont have to explain what is wrong. Its literally everything!! I could try and write what is good about it but there is only one word. NOTHING! This franchise has to go. Its been bad for some years and its not just about this latest dispute. The last franchise was useless but this current one is less than useless
1081,Worse service ever....looking alternatives,Here why I m saying that:
1082,Really need a 0 stars option,Just walk / get taxi / buy a camel.  Anything other than this *****
1083,The worse train company ever,"Very bad, horrible service."
1084,Just the worst train company ever.,I leave one  hour early than I should for work to make sure I actually get there on time and my return train has never arrived on time. NEVER.It may be 3-4 mins late or normally 10-15 but it has NEVER pulled into the station on time. Once more -  NEVER !
1085,Give me an alternative.,What an amazingly bad organisation. Classic monopoly. The idea that competition can work when you give out monopolies is incredible. This morning I discovered a new season ticket on my key card. Not mine. Not even the right station. Just added by a member of staff. The one I had bought would not load due to gate failure. Who knows what will happen next.
1086,Couldn't organise a p@*s up in a brewery,"By far the worst train service in the country, what should take 1hour twenty to get home has often taken me four to five house! The government needs to remove the franchise from Govia who have bitten off more than they can chew and sort it out. I doubt it was even this bad in BR days. You turn up to the station crossing your fingers it's going to be okay and invariably they let you down. Please please sort it out. If you don't have enough staff employ more it's not simple! This is the busiest commuter route on the network it needs to work!"
1087,3rd world train services have fewer delays.,"i recently damaged my car and decided to commute by train while it is fixed, i thought that it couldn't possibly be as bad as id heard from friends but just to be sure i decided to get on a earlier train. despite this i was made late for work DAILY over a 2 week period. not a single time in 2 week was southern rail running on time, sometimes i was made more then a hour late for what would be a 8 mile drive. it would have been quicker to cycle to work. in the end i decided that this was not worth the stress and simply purchased a new car rather then dealing with the torment of southern rail."
1088,Worse than a Burma railway,What an absolute farce. 14 hours from Victoria to Bognor Regis due to No trains. No train crew. Diversions and I ended up in Brighton at 11pm with no way to get home. Then I had to buy a new ticket to get to Bognor because my ticket was for the previous day. I applied for a refund and never got one. This crappy government needs to intervene and the board all be held to account. I should have walked. CRAP COMPANY. BADLY RUN.
1089,Southern Failway,"Like many, I have been using a variety of diffrent rail services with southern being the worst. I work a 9-5.30 office job and usually commute around an hour each way. Not with southern rail though as most the time I get home at 8pm. One example recently all trains were canceled on my line at london bridge, with no staff knowing what was going on. One reccomended going to victoira (obviously it was my presence delaying the trains). Once we finally set of, we stopped dead for around 30 mins. This became a regular occurence. I eventually got home in the quick time of 5 hours. Whats annoying is that this problem is not with the staff we see on a daily basis (they seem to do the best job they can while taking all the flak) its the managers and the directors who are on a completley diffrent plane of incompitence. I know people who can run rail mangement software with 4000+ services without one being late its an ABSOLUTE joke. And all we get is a sozm9 from the bosses. Claiming a refund is a joke, got a monthly or yearly ticket, here 90p for the 5 hours delay. Oh and I look foward to the ticket costs increasing next week, because I really want to award this rail company for its excelent service and policies."
1090,No service and impossible refunds,"With a service passengers can no longer rely on and an infuriating refund policy, Southern get my vote for the worst public transport company I have used in 30 years of commuting. Well done Southern, I hope you're proud."
1091,What are we waiting for before something is changed,"Everyday traveling on southern to London has been a nightmare. The service is always late and everyone seems to have taken it for granted that a journey advertised as 30min will take about 50 in real time. Last evening, just before my stop, they said the train has to go back a station after waiting midtrack for 15min. The driver didn't open the doors at the previous station and we stood 15 more when he announced we'll be going back 2 more spots - that's when I stopped listening. How can this be so mismanaged and unplanned. I pay just as much as any London commuter but the service is so terrible I want to move. Most station staff and passengers are disgruntled and these days I end up seeing/hearing at least one altercation everyday at the station due to train delays. What  are the authorities waiting for  before drastic measures are taken and the condition improved?"
1092,A JOKE!!! Only reason there is one star is because it won't allow you to leave a comment without selecting at least one star!,DISGRACEFUL train company. Website won't allow a negative rating and that's purely just because if it did the webpage would crash as result of all the comments that would be left on here! You shouldn't be allowed to continue running this farcical of what you call a service. We pay a fortune to TRY and use the service of which there isn't any. You're blatantly stealing from us! You should be ashamed!!!!
1093,So much for improving performance...,...by cutting trains. Take a look at the daily performance report for yesterday. Only 21% of trains on time.
1094,One star is too much,"I am so suprised that the British Government doesn't step and do something about this company. Their service is a joke. I have heard about people who have lost their jobs, people been late for interviews, peoples missing important appointments and the list goes on and on."
1095,One star is too good for southern,Train driver is delayed getting to our delayed train. Trains from Victoria station have been a joke for months!! Sack these incompetent fools and get people in who know how to run a train service.
1096,Southern Railway. WORST SERVICE EVER,"Worst experience of my life travelling on Southern Railway.I dont know how on earth they are hanging onto their franchise. Its high time it was taken off them. One day travelling back from London Victoria, train terminated at Haywards Heath. Told the next service to Eastbourne is over 35 mins LATE only for THAT to terminate at Haywards as well. Then told to go to Brighton. The following day was exactly the same except we only made it as far as Gatwick. The service is a JOKE . Little wonder all staff are off sick with stress when the management couldn't organise a 'binge drink in a brewery. ' I say, strip the company of the franchise. Hand them a massive fine, then name and sack every manager !!"
1097,"The garbage railway company, almost a liar thief","You have absolutely no possible travel schedule when you take the train of company, because you do not know how long it will takes to travel, the train will stop running at any time, at any time, will be canceled at any time, you need to be patient and waiting for the signal and to listen  to broadcast. even though there are  a few stops, you may be asked to wait for half an hour or an hour."
1098,they should be taken to court,"This company MUST be held to account, for all of the extra expense I have had to take on, and all of the delays and cancelations"
1099,Have i got a story for you...,"Well I bought a monthly season ticket for 460.10. Yes thats right 460 quid! but thats only the start. So it stopped working on the london terminals (it must have been bendy) So like anyone i went to the ticket office to get this re printed. What does the ticket person do? she takes it off me and states that the railcard is not valid proof of owning a monthly ticket, and for this reason she wouldnt give it back! your talking halfway through the month so like £250 worth!! that she wouldnt give back. I said well thats how it was sold to me? how is that my fault? only to be told sorry but you need a password when purchasing these. I refused to move like any other person would who was about to be significantly out of pocket due to the incompetance of southern railway. After kicking up enough stink and not moving for Britain (about an hour) i was eventually given it back but boy did i have to fight it. which poses the question. DO YOU PEOPLE KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING HALF THE TIME? not impressed."
1100,One big joke,"Southern are an absolute joke. Literally avoid travelling with them at all costs. Disgraceful service, single handedly ruining my relationships with people"
1101,Just simply rubbish,Incompetent
1102,"Unreliable, late, unplanned, red tape","I moved to Croydon about five years ago where sadly southern is the only train available. There has been a crew sickness notice on national rail for  months which means I've had experiences standing in a sedentary train at London bridge (not some remote station)  for 30-40 minutes with fellow passenger hanging on to every post available waiting for the driver to show. The last time this happened was at 7:50pm when I was returning from work rather late as I'd  arrived late that morning, again due to trains running late and chaos at every stopping station with passengers trying to get on but no space left. This has been the case for ages now and I've chosen to write this as I hope for change. Someone with some authority needs to step up and fix this."
1103,Pathetic and appaling,A terrible service that is getting worse by the day. They impact people's lives without care or accountability.  An utter disgrace the whole management team should be replaced and never be allowed to run anything ever again.
1104,Terrible!,"I've been traveling on Southern trains now for over 5 years and nothing has changed. Outdated smelly dirty trains, constant cancellations which are distressing especially when your southern train is a connection, delays, strikes and increasingly bad service."
1105,Jokers,Joke of a service.Why bother with a timetable when its just pot luck if the train you intended to catch turns up within 15 mins of its scheduled time. First rains in the morning cancelled or delayed. I use this service most days and it is a nightmare.
1106,Not Fit For Purpose,"I just dropped my son at coulsdon south, and guess what, two trains in a row 'delayed'. They were both showing as 'on-time' on the web just before we left for the station. Almost every time we have tried to travel with Southern recently the train has either been cancelled or delayed. What an utter waste of the fair-paying public's time and money. The franchise should be withdrawn from this completely useless company."
1107,Appalling service..no longer a train company,"I have used this company to commute to work for 10 years. I pay nearly£ 3000 pa. The service has always been bad but has deteriorated to the point that it no longer can be called a train company. I travel.from portsmouth to Barnham. Every evening my train is cancelled. Today all five trains in an hour and a half slot were cancelled. I had started to keep a record of the cancellations affecting just the Times I travel to and from work . In one 10 day period 40 trains were cancelled in that small window of time. The trains to London victoria now rarely run . This is a disgrace. The impact on people's lives of this chaos must be astronomic. I have had to cancel peoples job interviews, people have missed specialist medical treatment and so it goes on. The trains that do run on this line are the old london overground trains which I think are now 40 years old and disgusting..I have photos to prove it.  Parts of sub Sahara Africa have better trains. I understand the government minister responsible is unsympathetic to travellers and simply says that interfering when the company are trying their best would just make things worse. Well I know what to do.now at the next election!! I fear that there will be public disorder soon such is the growing anger and frustration. Southern railways - you are a joke please get out of my life and let a proper train company take over."
1108,3rd world trains,"Conductor sickness, faulty trains, strikes, faulty signals, unexpected delays. You name it, they got it - guaranteed."
1109,I have STD,"Southern Trains Disruption, this is a totally unreliable, inflexible and expensive joke of a service with constant delays and cancellations. If you have any alternative use it."
1110,Friendly staff and on time trains,Last week I went to seaford from Newhaven with my two kids and my son loves trains and waved at the driver as the train was coming towards us. As we got off at seaford the driver got off to get back on at the other end to travel back to brighton and asked if my son wanted to see here the driver sits! Of course my son said yes and even got to press the horn! The driver even asked me if it was ok to pick him up to put him on the seat. I was very impressed and the driver was such a nice man. You don't get many people who would take time out of their schedule to do this. Also the trains are always on time and I've never had a problem using them. Would recommend to anyone.
1111,This is the worst service ever,They always cancel trains and delay for over 30 minutes save yourself pls use the tube this is terrible I write this as I sit in balham station waiting for over 45 minutes for a train to London bridge this happens everyday am going hone its horrible
1112,Unbelievable !!!,"Let me start by saying I'm not a person who complains about this type of thing and in fact this is the first time I ever have ! And even 12 hours later I'm in despair with this joke of a service provided by Southern. I've been telling friends and family for a long time now how bad this company is and I just wonder how bad it has to get for the government to step in . My journey home from work every evening is filled with trepidation . I join my train at Clapham junction only 1 stop down from where the train starts its journey. Every evening trains are cancelled, late or seriously overcrowded. I've lost count of the number of times I've let a train depart because I just cant get on it because of overcrowding. A seat at this time of night (10-11pm ) is a luxury. I only travel one stop down to East Croydon but I'm often over an hour or more late . My wife even questions me now and asks "" what's going on "" las Im always late home lol !! I feel it's only when something bad happens and they investigate how many people are crammed into this poorly run service that anything will ever change. Just how bad does it have to get before the Government steps in ? (Fatalities????) Because I can't imagine it any worse than this shambles of a company! Sorry this review is so long , must be therapy of some kind lol !!!"
1113,Miserable Service,"A consistently awful service from these thieves over many years. My most recent experience involved a blatant refusal to sell me a return ticket at the lower price advertised on their website - £56.50 on the website, £81 in person - with no explanation why this was the case. Criminals."
1114,New ad slogan for Southern.,"THIEVES ON THE LINE, WHERE INCOMPETENCE COMES AS STANDARD"
1115,Terrible,I've been using Southern to commute to and from London for years it's far and away the worst service I have ever used and I'm shocked that's it's become even worse. Trains constantly late and the new excuse crew shortages and Conductor sickness is just a joke.  Southern should lose their franchise worst rail company in the UK.
1116,Ridiculas to the subline,"Southern Rail are cancelling services on the back of staff sickness and dismiss the bad service as the norm. Also customers are not being informed of route changes. I booked the 11.17 to Victoria in advance only to be told that the service terminates at Haywards Heath? When I boarded the delayed train, the driver proudly announced that the would go to Victoria. Also, the ride quality was very bad compared to my onward journey to Birmingham."
1117,"If I could give less than one star, I would","They've really gone downhill over the last couple of years or so. Trains now frequently delayed by ""temporary lack of train crew"", late-running or cancelled services. Drivers are called to their train over the tannoy at London Victoria. Trains arrive at a platform with less than the expected number of coaches, so passengers are squeezed in the carriages. Sometimes it's so bad you just have to laugh. How did it get like this?"
1118,HOW ARE THEY STILL IN BUSINESS???????????,ANOTHER HARD DAY AT WORK FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER NIGHTMARE JOURNEY HOME FROM LONDON TO BRIGHTON. TRAINS ALREADY CANCELLED THIS EVENING - ONCE AGAIN MISSING VALUABLE TIME WITH FAMILY AND ITS COSTING £427 PER MONTH FOR THE SERVICE. HOW MUCH MORE CAN WE TAKE AS CUSTOMERS!! THE FEW TRAINS THAT DO RUN ARE RAMMED WHICH IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS IN ITSELF! SOME DAYS I CANT EVEN GET HOME THANKS TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST NEVER HAPPY!
1119,Needs massive improvement,"Southern Rail is overpriced, overcrowded, understaffed, lacking vital investment for improvements, and delayed or cancelled more often than not for unacceptable reasons, like signalling failures. How many times do signals need to fail before you get a better system?"
1120,Impossible web-site,"Can anyone actually work round the new web-site?  In fact, does the designer actually use it?  I doubt it as it is the most frustrating meaningless train ticket booking web-site.  Sorry, but I'll revert back to the Trainline"
1121,New Website is rubbish!,Can't believe you've scrapped a perfectly good website for one that's impossible to use.  It's now easier to join a long queue at the ticket office than to book tickets online.  Well done you!!!!!!!
1122,Incompetent service and rude staff.,"Delays, cancelation, no refund and rude staff is this companies mission statement."
1123,New Website - What is the point??,"Same as other reviewers, I have been using the Southern Rail website for years without any problem."
1124,Worst Web Up(Down)grade ever,"Like others, have been using website for years. Ticket buying section was always good if rest of if could be frustrating. The new one is so poor that I now just have to join the queue at the ticket desk - completely the opposite outcome you'd expect on the back of their policy of reducing staff. Why do you think we need to see a map of where we are travelling to and from instead of being able to see how to buy a damn return ticket?"
1125,A total waste of time and nerves...,On the old website...booked a return journey in 90 seconds...picked tickets up in same amount of time at station...new website has failed to work on any occasion I try...so I queue to buy a ticket...clerk in ticket office just sighs and shrugs when I ask about purchasing online.
1126,Southern rail Website,"Totally inadequate website for tickets, unable to deliver correct information on train journeys and would let you buy tickets because its card payment system times out!!"
1127,The worst train company know to man,"Southern Rail is an absolutely dire and dysfunctional company. I do not exaggerate when I say that the majority of it's trains are delayed, and frequently so overcrowded that you can't have a seat. I understand Southern Rail was taken over by a company in the summer 2015, and seems to have subsequently sacked most of it's employees- resulting surprisingly in them not having enough staff to drive it's trains. I met a train driver for southern rail at barnham train station on my way home (due to an unexpected cancellation by southern), and he didn't know when the train he was supposed to be driving would arrive! I mean, really, how can a train driver not know when the train he's meant to be driving will turn up?!.. I've never experienced such a shocking lack of organisation in a company. They no longer reply when I submit a 'delay repay' form either- no doubt this is due to there being a shortage of staff to respond to my claims."
1128,southern's useless web page,"Totally impossible to sign up to the web page although , from the comments of others, that is probably just as well.  Used the old one for years with no problems.  Tried everything to log in to this one.  Their advice - I can still but tickets at the station!  Why can't we just have the old, working web page back?  Southern used to be ok but it has gone to the dogs in the past year.  Still got decent drivers and conductors - must be awful for them."
1129,New website bad!,"Have just wasted 10 minutes trying to find tickets from London to Durham,despite putting in all information required all that showed on screen was a MAP. Believe I know where Durham is ! No ticket choices or anything else. Is this just a problem on iPad?"
1130,Totally RUBBISH new website,I use Southern a lot to travel between Portsmouth and London. The new website is a total disaster. Extremely user-unfriendly. Most of the page is taken up by a map which adds nothing to my experience as a customer. The process of booking tickets has become much more confusing and good value tickets are extremely difficult to come across now. And the confirmation email which used to contain useful information such as the train time and reference number is now just a useless piece of electronic rubbish.
1131,Unbelievably bad,"Just when you thought the service couldn't get any worse, they introduced a new website - and it did! The old one worked fine. Now it's a mess to find anything, you have to print off forms and send to cancel a ticket, it doesn't retain personal details properly so you have to type in each time... And still running four-carriage trains from London to Brighton with people packed in wherever possible and standing all the way. This really is a third world service."
1132,Dire dire dire,The worst run train company. Too few trains not enough carriages constant delays and cancellations . Absolutely DIRE
1133,One of the worst train companies.,Their trains are constantly being delayed or cancelled. It's a disgrace. They are unbelievably awful and affect my journeys all the time. Absolutely unacceptable. Avoid them at all costs.
1134,"Not possible to buy tickets on the Internet,,,","It seems incredible that, in this day and age, it is not possible to buy tickets on the Internet to use on Southern Railway. They have a website, but it does not work. They used to have a website that DID work, very well, and you could collect tickets from the station ticket machine very easily. Now, you have to go to the station and queue up to buy tickets. In 2015. Incredible. I have tried to call their Customer Services but have held on for exactly 23 minutes..... and have really too much else to do."
1135,TOD doesn't work,"I booked a return ticket from London to Manchester and when I tried to collect it the machine said it was unable to process the request.  Staff in the ticket office tried and had the same problem.  I phoned Customer Services and they said the quickest way to resolve the problem would be to cancel the ticket and rebook.  I rebooked the same journey (and by this time it was too late to get a seat reservation) and when tried to collect the tickets I had exactly the same problem.  I see another reviewer, Graham Bryce, reported this problem at the end of October but it has clearly not been fixed."
1136,Why don't they allow a Zero star option?,"The first website in the history of the world that makes you spend 15 minutes trying to find times and schedules, and then refuses to accept payment by credit card or debit card (even those that it had accepted for years before the upgrade), and I'm sure there are other methods of payment that it refuses to accept."
1137,Shocking new website,"I'm comfortable reporting that the new much-trumpeted beta version is worse in every respect than the existing site. In summary, it's slow, buggy and worst of all, it rips off the ticket-buying public."
1138,You may as well walk.,"I've only been using this rail to commute into Brighton for a short while, and it is probably the worst experience I've had with trains. In fact it's so bad I've decided not to continue working in Brighton. Nearly every day there is a delay or cancellation, and it is total pot luck if you get where you want on time. In fact it's so bad that the government should probably intervene and force a sale. I think maybe the company is run by 3 year olds or by people so corrupt that it cannot be run at all. I'll be glad to never use them again."
1139,Useless!!!,Simply I would be embarrassed if I managed this company. Always cancelled. Always delayed. Never reliable. I wish we had another choice of train service.
1140,Awful customer service and consistent delays,Travel on Southern Rail every week and there are consistent delays on the trains. There are also frequent cancelled services. Avoid travelling with this company if possible.
1141,Lost Proprerty,"Travelled on both Southwest & Southern Trains one evening making my way home. Left my work folder on one of those trains. Southern conveniently have a number you can call to check if it has been found and an online forn, with very helpful staff. Southern have no number, just an online form. I called customer service and got no service. I was told it would take two week to hear anything back and I have no way to follow up? That is rediculous and Frustrating."
1142,The Rail Company that hates its customers,Southern Rail:
1143,Southern railway are s**t to put it bluntly.,"Southern railway are the worst service i have ever used in my life, so unorganized they couldn't arrange a p**s up in a brewery. I use this service daily as my commute to work and every day im faced with late running trains and even cancellations because they ""don't have the staff"" why they expect me and many other customers to pay such a vast amount of money for a service that my 7 and 4 year old sister could run better is beyond me. I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't for the fact that im now having to get a train AN HOUR EARLIER just to get myself to work on time, it's a f***ing joke. Sort your s**t out southern, and believe me when i say if this carries on the way it's going, ill be seeing you in court very soon, because I refuse to have my job put on the line because of a bunch of incompetent pricks like yourself. Have a great day."
1144,The Un-Smartcard,After persevering for 2 months I gave up after many phone calls to customer services and a Smartcard customer services that does not work after 5pm. The card loaded once and cost in telephone calls is not worth the hassle. #AVOID
1145,Complete Lack of Customer Service,"I have been using Southern trains for almost 15 years to get between London and Brighton.  So, so many times, whether announced well in advance or not, there are ongoing engineering works which result in me having to take a route which is at least twice as long.  Sometimes, this has involved a bus journey which only takes me about a third of the way home.  Of course, this costs the same as the already highly priced direct journeys I should be able to take."
1146,Worst thing to ever happen in UK transportation history.,The dark ages of railway in the UK is Southern Rail.
1147,Worst train service ever,I booked a train ticket online and when I went to collect it they didn't recognise my ticket! Went ticket office they didn't recognise it. I phoned southern to which they said they recognised it but I have to buy a new ticket anyway! Incompetent company! Then they said apply for a refund which may take 28 days and they may charge me admin fees for?!
1148,Terrible service,"Trains are late or get cancelled on a regular bases, usually due to crew shortage. When you make a delay claim, it gets reject for no reason, so that you have to submit it several times. I hope they lose the franchise as soon as possible."
1149,Terrible website,Unusable new website
1150,new website is worse than previous,New Website has problems and people often by the wrong tickets because of it. It has already happened to me.  I have sent a complaint but haven't received any reply.
1151,Useless new booking website,"I used the 'old' system with no problem. After two e-mail replies from the company telling me how to re-set my password (both failed), I have given up. Southern, you are losing so many customers. But then, of course, I have been buying full price fares since December. Is there a reason for their not fixing the issues?? Will start using Virgin after coming across this website. how much are you paying the web designers? Even if I could get onto it I wouldn't use the new site for reasons listed elsewhere on the trustpilot.com site."
1152,Refund Policy A JOKE,"I used their useless website to book a £6 journey.  It told me that my bank had refused the payment.  It really hadn't so I tried again.  Same result. I decided to buy a ticket at the station.  However I then get an email from them thanking me for my orders and charging me twice.  Not very good. They admitted it was their fault  but trying to get a refund has been difficult to say the least.  I ring them and they tell me there is a letter in the post or a recorded message saying they are aware of this problem and can you call back in a week or so.  And so it goes.  Today I spoke with AJ. He was actually helpful.  He asked if I'd had an email from them, well, no actually! Nor have I had the letter I was promised. I spoke with AJ's supervisor, Beverley,  to voice my concerns over this whole debacle. She told me that I have to download and print out a claim form from their website, fill it in and send it to them together with a copy of my bank statement showing the relevant details.  I don't think so. It's £6 so I won't bother. The problem was and is of their making but they want me to jump through hoops to fix it. Dreadful service and I would like an apology."
1153,Website utterly unusable,"I used the previous one most days and now, ridiculously, book my tickets on GWR website!!  I would be very happy if they sorted it out and I would return."
1154,Dreadful new booking form,After seeing all these reviews I am very glad to see I am not the only one who thinks the new online train booking system by Southern is a total joke.The old one was fine why change it ? It is unfit for use.Will have to use another train companies site now.This one is totally unusable.
1155,Website is unusable,The new Southern Website booking journey is shameful! I want to book a simple one-day off-peak Travelcard from Gatwick Airport to London today and can't do it via the site. Only 'anytime' single and return tickets are available. The website simply isn't fit for purpose.
1156,New Website,An absolute frustrating experience trying to use the new website. I did email the company but with no real answer. I now book with either Virgin or East Midlands trains as they are much easier
1157,Website totally unusable; now using the lovely Virgin Trains East Coast site,"Where do I start on the nightmare of using the new Southern website?? Had to re-register with a different email address as they wouldn't migrate my password. They require you to choose a particular train before you see the prices on offer for different times - why can't we have the nice list of trains and prices as before? and as on the highly useable Virgin Trains East Coast site, on which you can buy Southern tickets at a good price and collect them from your Southern station. There's plenty more that I could say - not storing your data and journey history, navigation hopeless, imperfect price info ....  Southern, PLEASE bin it and return to your old system; I shan't be buying from you until you do."
1158,Truly terrible service in all respects,6 out of 8 of my last journeys either cancelled or delayed. Station staff unhelpful and rude. Taxis put on when train cancelled did not arrive. On one occasion train so full it turned people away from boarding. A very terrible all round service
1159,Trains cancelled every weekend,"Trains cancelled every weekend, also being told ""don't travel"" and to ""try and get a refund"" due to trains being rammed during the May bank holiday Saturday. Just because I am disabled and need to be sat down. But they don't seem to make any ""reasonable adjustments"" or give a damn about the Disabled People's Protection Policy!"
1160,About as low as a Railway can get…,About as low as a Railway can get without bordering in The Third World.(At least w'eve GOT platforms!Lol)
1161,"No stars, extortionate and rude",Just like everyone else I am only leaving one star because there is no option for zero.
1162,Stood in someone elses urine when…,Stood in someone elses urine when trying to change my babies nappy. She droped her stuff in it so had to throw it away.
1163,Weekend cancellations,"Service is so bad between Paddington and Bath that I have decided to drive, which will be cheaper, more comfortable and above all more reliable. These weekend cancellations when the weather is good are a disgrace. Train managers tell me that do not need to work at weekends because they get paid same rate as overtime during the week (which they can get plenty of), so when the weather is good, they would prefer not to work at weekends. When you can get a seat on the new trains, they are so uncomfortable that I am getting back problems. Remove GWR franchise immediately, they must surely be in breach of their conditions."
1164,Customers are a terrible inconvenience…,Customers are a terrible inconvenience to GWR. They need to lose their Franchise. Look at all these one star reviews.
1165,worst part of my day for 5 days a week,"worst part of my day for 5 days a week. Almost always late, with frequent cancellations and unannounced platform changes. I pay them  £1600 per year and in exchange they provide a terrible service. I would give them 0 if it was possible. An absolutely disgusting company."
1166,Awful service,Always delaying or remaining stuck at some station because there are remote problems like signals problems or something else.....the carriages are stinking very dirty and so the toilets where I got an awful  skin infection
1167,A terrible experience again and again...,"A terrible experience again and again. Filthy, crowded and expensive trains. Once for no seeming reason once just arrived in the wrong station and terminated with all passengers stranded. They simply don't deserve the amount of money they charge. Suggest walking in the future you,ll get there faster and fitter. #ashamedofourtrains"
1168,Why are so many GWR trains being…,"Why are so many GWR trains being cancelled because they have no train drivers available, hardly an unforeseen event."
1169,New trains in dire nead of more comfortable seating,"I spend £2000 a month on GWR rail from Paddington-Cardiff services sometimes more, the new GWR 800 trains are constantly late running often arriving in Cardiff from London for at least 80% of the time between 15-35 min late. The seats are horrific and Solid with Zero comfort compared with the older HST125 trains."
1170,Honestly they don’t care about quality…,Honestly they don’t care about quality of service of customer satisfaction. Constantly delayed and no compensation! Other railways are far better
1171,Poor service but unfortunately no competition!,"Needed to change my tickets online but the website kept crashing. I called customer service, waited 10 min to talk to a human being only to be told that I had to go to the nearest train station or change them online because Customer Service at GWR do not have the facilities to change tickets for you. Now my question is where does the money go? Definitely neither in the trains and infrastructure, nor in the service..."
1172,Despicable service,"For 2 mornings running GWR think it is Ok to send a 5 carriage train at peak time as opposed to 8 carriages, and no reserved seats!  Passengers paying for very expensive seats on peak trains and having to stand in conditions worse than cattle - is this acceptable?   To add to this yesterday I arrived home nearly 2 hours late due to an endless list of train faults, lack of drivers and signalling problems.  Another evening at home GWR have deprived me of! :("
1173,This is meant to be zero stars,"This is meant to be zero stars. Honestly don't understand how GWR are still allowed to operate. Abysmal service, dishonesty, disorganisation and all round abuse of consumers. Trains are always well over the safety limits of capacity, always delayed, and on the rare occasion that they aren't late, they are cancelled. Someone please save us from GWR - enough is enough."
1174,Where is my refund????,"Journey was end of January but cancelled as driver hadn't turned up. Refund agreed within days but 3 months later and numerous calls to chase, I still have not received it. JUST REFUND MY MONEY!!"
1175,15:00 Paddington to Tiverton,15:00 Paddington to Tiverton: The one announcement that was actually audible said that the team hadn't had sufficient time to put out the reservation tickets.
1176,No apology or compensation for being called a liar and being delayed by 2 hours on a 25 minute journey,"Having had GWR delay my train by about 2 hours, I applied for a refund, and was told that my train wasn't late."
1177,Horrible,Horrible. Constantly delayed. It kills time as always the train has to be either delayed or cancelled. Such a awful train 😡
1178,Awful customer service from a woman…,Awful customer service from a woman with curly dark hair at Bristol! Distrurbed by her customer service! Do not appreciate her she deserves to be fired by this attitude!!!!
1179,Disgusting Service,Disgusting Service
1180,Constantly delayed trains,"Constantly delayed trains, ridiculous pricing."
1181,12 year old script kiddies could have designed a better website,Their new website is an absolute slug kludge nest of horrors.
1182,Horrible,"For 500 pounds per month GWR makes me constantly late for work as what is supposed to be a 27 minute train journey often takes 45+ minutes; it also makes me waste half my evening trying to get home -- as I write this we're stuck outside Paddington with no explanation whatsoever for 20 minutes now; the seats are super uncomfortable if you manage to get one, the Wi-Fi is slow as hell, but hey, I don't have a choice but to spend 3 hours of every single business day on a train listening to meaningless apologies of the train manager...oh wait, this just in: the train broke down and we are advised to take a different one. Great job, Great Western Railway."
1183,New Hitachi 800 trains are a major…,New Hitachi 800 trains are a major downgrade compared with the previous rolling stock. What is billed as First Class seats are now inferior in quality to the second class seats in the previous trains. So in reality GWR are now charging a first class fare for a second class seats and those in second class are getting a third rate seat quality.
1184,Staffing issues at Banbury station,"Train and transportation services are great and often reliable. However some choices of staff are questionable - often rude and insulting, not helpful at all. I bought an open return ticket and when told that I couldn’t use it, the staff were blunt and didn’t even ask if I needed another ticket when they saw I was in a rush. I have had friends who have been insulted before about their characteristics by the same team of staff at Banbury station. Absolutely appalled."
1185,Yet another 1 star review of GWR,"Yet another 1 star review of GWR.  Easter Sunday, a ticket booked for a Swindon to Chippenham journey.  On arriving at the station the train had been cancelled due to ""lack of drivers"".  As had the one after it.  Spoke to GWR staff who said that they had no responsibility to help as there was another train in 3 hours time.  Absolutely appalling, as ever!"
1186,Website is crap,"Website is crap, travel everyday on packed train from Exmouth to Exeter, dirty trains never get a seat."
1187,Thank you very much for making my…,Thank you very much for making my commute stressful. Staff are rude.
1188,Awful,I unforantly have to use GWR 5 days a week to get to work in London.
1189,Awful!,"As the previous commentator said ""No stars"" would be more appropriate. It is a terrible ""service"" if you can call it that! Cancellations, delays, over crowding and trains terminated before their final destination."
1190,Complete idiot staff as usual,"Cancelling trains because there are, and I quote ""no drivers"", pathetic on a Friday night at any time but on a holiday weekend, stupidity from the usual school of idiot management inside the organisation - you're all a joke really"
1191,Shocking new trains,Shocking new trains - designed like a public toilet but with less comfortable seating
1192,Joke of a company.,"Writing this review whilst sat on the floor for 2 hours outside the toilet. Terrible service, not getting any better. It's a joke of a company and should be ashamed."
1193,GWR Rip Off,GWR really don't deserve a 1*. Their service is utterly shocking. We pay a fortune to stand crammed against each other like sardines and the staff seem to care little. The service in India is better.
1194,The worst railway to ever travel with,"The worst railway to ever travel with. They dont take customers seriously, they dont care about customers experience, all they care about is increasing journey cost and ripping of travelers."
1195,Awful awful awful GWR,"If I could, the rating would be zero. It is an awful position to be stuck having to use GWR to get from Cornwall to London. I have a ticket booked. I want to check online train running etc (given recent weather) ... but GWR website incapable to doing anything other than getting itself tied into a continuous data loop. Opted to use the 'online chat' option ... I guess all of those people are busy trying to get into work by GWR trains ...."
1196,"GWR - unreliable,dirty,poor shocking,complacent, smug etc","GWR has to be one of the most shocking railway providers around.  I pay over a GBP 1000 a month for a sub standard poor, dirty unreliable service between Newbury and London Paddington. A ridiculous amount but first class is the only way to guarantee a seat, one hopes!"
1197,Terrible service,"Terrible service! I’ve used GWR from Maidenhead to Paddington on 4 serperate occasions delays there and back every time. “Faults on the line”, “Red signal issues”.... BS! Ironic it’s occurred on all separate occasions there and back. On average delays of 35 mins+"
1198,I travel on average three times a week…,I travel on average three times a week between Reading and London at peak times and the services has got significantly worse in the last three months.  I usually have to stand both ways and the morning services never arrives on time.  I pay £480 a month for this terrible service.  Easy money for GWR who have no competition.
1199,No stars would be more appropriate.,No stars would be more appropriate.
1200,Constant issues,"Every single time I travel on GWR there is an issue. I travel regularly from Truro to London for work. The air con is broken, trains are cancelled regularly, trains are overcrowded leaving people standing and sitting in the aisles (often because of cancellations) the coffee shop is closed due to lack of staff, or the coffee shop hasn’t been restocked, or the coffee machine is broken etc etc. Recently a visiting friend who is in a wheelchair  was left having to change trains without the pre requested assistance - thankfully other passagers were kind enough to help. It’s highly unreliable and inconsistent in its service. Which doesn’t make for a comfortable or confident journey."
1201,GWR need to really sort themselves out,"GWR need to really sort themselves out. Been using the service for 10 years seeing family members. Sunday 8th July the worse journey ever. Air conditioning broke, trains delayed hence missed connection back to Poole, and dirty stinky toilets. Only thing in the companies favour guards gave out small bottles of water but this was very limited."
1202,LIFE THREATENING OVERCROWDING,"Today on the 16.01 from Exeter to London myself and other train passengers had to assist the train manager with one of the most dangerous overcrowded trains any of us had ever been on or seen. People were forced to stand in 28+ degree temperatures, all the water ran out, the buffet carriage was closed due to staff shortages and a young lady with learning disabilities, DUE TO HAVING TO STAND FOR OVER 4 HOURS, COLLAPSED AND COULDN'T BREATH, PARAMEDICS WERE CALLED AND AN EMERGENCY STOP WAS MADE. A local paramedic made an emergency visit onto the train to administer oxygen and then she was admitted to hospital. This was ALL BECAUSE THE TRAIN WAS SO DANGEROUSLY OVERCROWDED!! I was travelling with my four-year-old son - ALL THE WATER RAN OUT AND PASSENGERS WERE LEFT ON THE PLATFORM IN 30 DEGREE TEMPERATURES WITH NO ACCESS TO ANY WATER. Myself and another passenger had to get into the buffet carriage to get supplies for all of the other passengers including people traveling with children who were getting dangerously dehydrated. We started a petition and got over 100 signatures. We would have got many more but the carriages were too full to get the petition around. GWR needs to ACT NOW!!!"
1203,Bought tickets months before,"Bought tickets months before, and paid for reserve seating. Sunday afternoon, boiling hot, 1.5 hour journey to London and the train is packed. They cancelled the previous train and just void all pre-booked seating. The train was so full people sitting in the aisles, in doorways etc. It is just not acceptable service. I will if possible never use a company like this again. Total chaos!!!!"
1204,well the start of another journey from…,"well the start of another journey from he'll thanks to gwr my first train to Gloucester delayed by nearly an hour guess that's speak for they cancelled one as the trains are hourly,"
1205,Horrific experience!,"This is an absolute JOKE! I am on a train to St. Ives from Paddington, and this is the worst rail service I have ever experienced. As previous reviewers mentioned it is a third world country service at inflated prices. Hundreds of people are crammed in carriages, unseated with no air conditioning and obviously very difficult to access the toilet."
1206,A Third World service but at inflated cost,"The most expensive rail fares in Europe for a service that would make urchins on the Calcutta railways gulp in disbelief. My erstwhile regular 07.45 train into Reading seems to be cancelled more often than not, which means the next train along (just 3 carriages and delayed) is grossly overcrowded. The overcrowding and oppressive, airless heat I experienced today was the worst I can remember. To add insult to injury, GWR sent me a £5 ""thank you for staying on board"" credit but, when I tried to use it, their website kept rejecting it. I finally found some small print saying the credit was not valid for a return journey! What the bleeding use is that? Do you honestly believe you have customers who want to travel somewhere without coming back?"
1207,In a word- appalling.,In a word- appalling.
1208,1st.July Sunday 11.30  Salisbury to…,1st.July Sunday 11.30  Salisbury to Portsmouth.
1209,DISGUSTING AND POOR SERVICE,"Travelled to London on the 29/6/18 for an overnight break. Was due to return on the 30.6.18 on the  4:12 from Paddington to Cardiff however because of your poorly trained and abusive staff I missed the train. The saga began with the platform being announced and on the departures board, where there was a massive surge of people running for the train and staff hurrying people along, I guess as it had gone 4:12 they were up against it and wanted the train out ASAP. My ticket would not go through the machine, I went to the male staff member on the gates, his badge said Stephen. He told me I did not have the correct ticket ?? and brushed me aside, I was panic stricken, my friends were already through and he would not help me. A female staff member looked at my ticket and let me through stating the ticket was fine?? However they would not let me on the train and it left. I was shocked and distraught. Stephen was laughing and mocking me as I returned to the gates. I did not think he was professional and told him so. The female staff member said I could get the next train. I asked for his name and he went ballistic, shouting at me and came through the gate right in my face shouting"" Stephen"" . I felt very intimidated and scared of him. He was very aggressive towards me. I left the area as he continued to shout at me and then justifying himself to the female staff member who was very quiet and stood with her head down. Very unhelpful situation, he needs training in how to deal with CUSTOMERS.. if he is on the frontline of your service you have a big problem. Stephen is lucky I made it home on time to be able to top up my insulin or he would have been looking at far worse charges. Out of principal the  next time I intend to travel I will use a bus company and factor in the time difference as part of my trip. Disgusting way to be treated when I paid enough for a service that I did not get. SHAMEFUL. BTW - your air conditioning is poor and staff announcements are a waste of time as they can't be heard.... I had to ask what the announcement was about  and was told that if I wanted refreshment I needed to get off the train at the next stop and go to the first 5 cars where there was refreshment trolley ????  Was it because ""the trolley"" doesn't fit throughout your trains or that they just couldn't be bothered to come through the cars???  again a poor service on what looked to me to be a relatively new train. LAUGHABLE."
1210,"aweful service, as in a developing country","Delays and issues are as often as in a developing country. Should be called little western railway. Unbelievable to see such an expensive and unreliabl service in Great Britain, the Industrial Revolution country ...."
1211,Crap!,"Crap!. Late train today. Most trains were cancelled. Swapped at Bristol and got on the cattle train with no air con, (new hitachi train mind!) delayed all the way to Swindon. Glad to get off as was boiling. Same on way back delay delay delay! Utter crap !!! I’ll drive next time!"
1212,Never a day goes by now without my…,"Never a day goes by now without my phone pinging an alert from GWR. Cancellations, staff not turning up, fewer coaches, trains breaking down...despite the new Hitachi sets. What's going on? Now beginning to rival Southern Rail for inefficiency but without the outcry. Just suffering another cancellation and an hour and a half wait for the next service...."
1213,Took the 14:27 service from London…,"Took the 14:27 service from London Paddington to Penzance on Sunday 3rd June, 2018."
1214,Government-Assisted Robbers,First Group is worth 5 Billion dollars but refuses to treat its high-paying customers humanely with its ample resources.
1215,Service was rubbish,The service was uselss big time over crowded bags in walk was full of bags witch is a health safety issue in a big way as I do work for the security industry
1216,Shockingly unreliable and a total rip-off,"The ""service"" is a disgrace for what a modern train company should provide. Among the most expensive train tickets in the world and will invariably be late or cancelled."
1217,Travelling to see the Rolling Stones in…,Travelling to see the Rolling Stones in Cardiff with a journey carefully planned to arrive in time to see the support band too. Who wouldn't?
1218,Where do I begin?,Totally shocking how this company gets away with the services it runs between Cardiff and Bristol Temple Meads.  Often sending trains (late) with insufficient numbers of carriages for the hundreds of passangers unfortunate enough to rely on them for their daily commute.
1219,Abhorrent,"Abhorrent, disgusting company. It is so unfortunate that there is no competition down in the south west (yet!). I travel"
1220,Well done in difficult circumstances,"Well done to the train guard on the 15.23 from Exmouth to Paignton train yesterday.  The train was late and very crowded but he was able to get everyone on board, including several passengers who needed the ramps.  He never flapped and was efficient and polite throughout the journey and giving a personal apology as the train came into Paignton.  The situation was not the fault of the staff but his attitude was exceptional and deserves praise."
1221,Shocking service and very rude staff,Shocking service and very rude staff. Really wish I didn't have to use them. How their allowed to provide such a terrible service for so long I have no idea. Money changing hands somewhere
1222,Train cancelled frequently at short…,"Train cancelled frequently at short notice. Predictable most Sundays. Trains run consistently late into London. Had one service with a leaky carriage soaking everyone's luggage and the people who had to stand in the corridor as there weren't enough seats. On the positive, I think they have good staff, free WiFi on trains which they offer should be the norm. However these can't make up for the poor quality of carriage and service for the money they charge."
1223,just got off yet another dreadful GWR…,"just got off yet another dreadful GWR train journey. completely over crowded, late, no buffet car, airconditioning broken, wifi not working."
1224,Absolutely jarring,Absolutely jarring. I have been unfortunate enough to use great Western 4 times in the last 2 weeks and I have missed my connecting train twice and missed appointments on the other 2 occasion. All in the space of 2 weeks. I don't know who regulates this service but they are absolutely disgraceful.
1225,19.03 from Paddington to Plymouth…,"19.03 from Paddington to Plymouth Friday, 25th May, over-crowded to the point that many passengers with tickets, still on the platform because they could not get on.  First stop, Reading and no one could get on.  It is disgraceful that the company sold tickets, knowing that the train was beyond full.  This is only the second time I have travelled with GWR and on both occasions it was the same...passengers standing in the aisles and ""lobby"" areas.  It must be a health and safety issue."
1226,Well the train from exeter to taunton…,"Well the train from exeter to taunton was late and we ended up missing our connecting train to bridgwater and was made to wait an hour in the cold, myself, my mother and other were not impressed at all"
1227,Prices go up and service goes down,Shouldn't even get 1 star....Prices go up and service goes down. Yet again my train has been cancelled causing me to be squeezed onto a later train with my kids....we had to stand for 40 mins and then sit separately because of other seat reservations
1228,Bath Spa Station jobsworths,"The jobsworths at Bath Spa station need to learn how to help customers not tick them off. I went to the ticket counter as supposedly the machines were “not working “. I asked for a return ticket to Goring & Streatley. Prior to today I had checked the website and had seen the price for a return ticket was roughly £26, so much to my surprise and shock when the jobsworth behind the counter said the price was £45.80!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I said “what!?, no that’s not right- that’s daylight robbery”. There was no help from this individual to find me a cheaper route. I eventually found a ticket to instead to Didcot for a fraction of the price - £25.70!!!!!!!! So please explain why a journey lasting only 1 1/2hrs can be equivalent in price to a 5 hour journey to Cornwall!!!!?????"
1229,GWR 1st Class Rip Off,"On the train at the moment, South Wales to London, 1st Class carriage is terrible, the seats are the same as standard which are narrow and very uncomfortable. The pictures they show on their site are nothing like the seats you will get."
1230,Great Western Railway???...?,"Great Western Railway???...?? Could the word Great please be dropped? There is nothing great about it. Expensive journeys, no seats, delays and train cancelled again today, allegedly due to train breakdown. Railway should be droped too. Most routs are covered by very expensive bus replacement services... As per Western, well, the most western point you can get to by Great Western Railway from London is Reading... I feel sorry for commuters, some G?W?R? employees and the GWR band that plays at Paddington today hated due to its association to the company. I paid £29 for a single journey to be at my destination in 2 hours. With waiting times and changes it will now take 4 hours. It would have taken me £12 by car and only 3 hours.. Why do we put up with this?"
1231,Terrible train company,I am dependant on GWR for my commute home every day and it's some of the most infuriating train service I have ever dealt with.
1232,Can the wifi be improved?,"The trains are of variable quality but are improving as new stock is rolled ou. I am never sure, however, whether a train will turn up with 1,2,3 or 4 carriages. The train can get very crowded when there are few carriages."
1233,Zero star review,"Zero star review! Constant cancellations and delays. It’s safe to say that the paying customer is the last thing that this company cares about. You should hang your head in shame for this appauling service. No announcements, cancelled trains, delays all the time. I am not the only one out here who is suffering, disgraceful service, what more is there to say!"
1234,A disgraceful shambles,"A disgraceful shambles, they have no idea. Not even the courtesy to install a queuing system on the 'customer services' phone', let along employ enough staff. 16 minutes waiting then transferred to another queue where the phone just rings... and rings... and rings and this is in the evening, well away from peak daytimes when it's not even worth trying. And after all they say that I can only amend my booking on the website, which is not even loading my account, which is why I phoned instead. The final advice: go to a station to buy your ticket!!"
1235,19.03 departure London Paddington to…,"19.03 departure London Paddington to Plymouth, absolutely packed with passengers still standing all the way to Taunton. Overcrowded to the point where there must be real health and safety issues. No restaurant as train despatched with no kitchen (not the first time this has happened in the last 2 months), running 45 minutes late. Usual comical tannoy announcements from train staff ridiculing management as inept as ever. A service not fit for purpose, just arriving at my station minutes before compensation kicks in - funny that and the second time in a month. Trains were better equipped and faster 25 years ago."
1236,Early trains axed in the Surrey Hills.,"I live in the Surrey Hills and was appalled to learn this morning that the early train to Guildford and Reading has a been removed from the new timetable. This comes without warning or public consultation, and is completely unacceptable. Scores of customers from stations between Dorking Deepdene and Guildford will not be able to get to work on time. How can this be? The first train from Chilworth is now at 08.03, no good to anybody."
1237,Still Waiting For Refund After 3 Months ! ! ! !,Due to the bad weather in February GWR offered a full refund on their website if you applied before the date of travel - I did this and uploaded the correct documents as requested - It is now mid may and still waiting for my refund ! ! ! Been fobbed off 3 times via email about there has been an error or your payment was sent incorrectly etc etc - I have never dealt with such an inept company - The money is now not an issue as more of a principle issue and i am taking legal action - Would never use again ! BOOKING REFERENCE W9H5T6W2
1238,The amazing lady on tonight with long…,The amazing lady on tonight with long blonde hair in a pony tail allowed me to use the station phone when my mobile became locked answering a call during no reception on a train! I see this lady nearly every day and she has amazing customer service!! Please employ more people like her I wish I got/noticed her name but everyday I'm always in a rush but tonight showed the level of customer service!!! Please call me if you want me to confirm but I will personally bring her some recognition for her actions tonight and she was so quick to help and in customer service it's expected and never realised I was on the the Reading basingstoke arriving at approx 21:30 wearing red with red earings black jeans and black/white Nike trainers with a little pink. Massive thank you! 07904988200 very impressed customer  😁
1239,AWFUL SERVICE,AWFUL SERVICE. On the 28th may 2017 I was delayed from Southampton Central to Cardiff Central on the 11:54 and then the 12:54 services. I put in a request for a delay repay 1-2 days later for being over 3hours delayed.
1240,Hopeless web site,I only use GWR 4 or 5 times a month in the main for  journeys from Maidenhead to Reading and to Gatwick.  On the whole and over the last 5 years or so the train service has been decent with only the odd bad experience usually due to bad weather or some technical issue. Based on other reviews here perhaps I have been lucky but for me 4* is fair.
1241,Dreadful,"Dreadful, no seats, dirty, very late or usually cancelled with no notice. There is something seriously wrong with the train line. Very expensive to stand next to men who seem very excited to be up close and personal to a woman. Or pick pockets enjoying the moment."
1242,No Christamas spirit at GWR!,"I took a short trip from Hook to Reading involving one change of train. On the outbound journey I lost my outbound ticket (I still had the return and receipt), the ticket inspector on the second leg was OK and having showed him the return had no problem. Arriving at Reading was a different matter. With no ticket I was unable to exit the station, I explained the situation to a member of staff but he refused me exit and said that I needed to go to the ticket office. At the office I explained what had happened and showed them the receipt and return ticket (day return), they insisted that I needed a ticket and charged me £6.30 for the replacement. GWR stands for Great Western Ripoff!!"
1243,Not able to refund my ticket online,Not able to refund my ticket online. Bad website!
1244,Diabolical service,Diabolical service and an extortionate pricing model. I thought South Eastern Trains was bad until I was forced into using this dreadful company.
1245,If I could give NO stars I would,"If I could give NO stars I would. A weekend Xmas Market trip from London to Bath totally ruined by having to stand both ways on an overcrowded, packed train, including a dangerous return journey squashed into the cold, draughty area between carriages where the floor moves constantly...with NOTHING except a broken piece of rubber sealant to hold onto for over TWO HOURS... and to top it all, they still include First Class carriages that could take some of the overflow. Call this a service? Pathetic! Hang your heads in shame!"
1246,Infuriating,"My partner and I have been travelling between London and South Wales more or less every weekend for the past year. The train has never been on time when arriving into Wales. Not once in 12 months. It's been as bad as 2 hours late, and as good as 10 minutes late. For the price of train fare this service is a joke."
1247,Avoid Friday night First Class,In general the trains are nearly always on average 10-15 mins late.
1248,Pathetic,The staff are fine but the tardy timetable and inadequate carriages are not acceptable when you consider this is by far the most expensive rail system in Europe. How rail firms justify annual increases whilst the service is so utterly terrible is beyond comprehension.
1249,Stuck once again thanks to Greatly …,Stuck once again thanks to Greatly Worsening Railway.  After weeks of delays and cancellations thanks to network repairs a train breaks down. No replacement even though the 20.15 and 21.15 normally both run at over seating capacity.  The British rail network is a shoddy comparison to other comparable countries.  Back to my car I think.
1250,Dire New GWR Intercity Trains,"New GWR intercity trains are diabolical. Have about as much charm and luxury as a public toilet. Cold, austere, uncomfortable, no facilities, no buffet. Really, really, really bad. Unless you come from North Korea in which case they might, possibly, suffice. Perhaps they could mark on timetables which services use the new trains so we can all avoid them? That's a genuine suggestion."
1251,Staff very helpful.  Public very rude!,"Taking a chance as my journey is ongoing. 29/10/17 on the 12.10 to Paignton from Reading. Started in Basingstoke.  Engineering works and London bound people on coaches.  Train coming through for Machester and packed.  People wanting to use it to get to Reading, despite a local link 10mins later. Abusing staff horribly and no manners. At Reading,  the customer service man on platform 7 was fab. Some problems and reservations not available as booked. Came back and got me on train with bag. Sorted.  Public quite rude"
1252,different standards,"Why is it when I travel first class the service differs so much, tonight I asked for a sandwich and crisps same as I had last week, was told we don’t do sandwiches at weekends so just had crisps, next time they came around asked for some nut apparently they don’t do nuts any more, not happy if I knew before I got on the train could have picked something up at Paddington , sort it out GWR"
1253,"This review has been cancelled, your next available review is 40 minutes delayed and won't stop at your station due to signaling problem.","I regularly use GWR on the Bristol - Trowbridge line. I have no other alternative to get to work, which is very unfortunate for me. The amount of time I have to waste due to cancelled or delayed services is astounding. I will never get this time back, GWR is wasting my life... literally. How can such a bad service be priced so high is beyond me. The trains that do turn up are filthy and overcrowded. 'We are sorry to announce that the 9:07 service to Westbury has been cancelled. This is due to more trains than usual needing repairs.' I do not get this excuse. They say it every time. By now they should have realized that usually half of their fleet is down, so it is not more than usual, it is just another day in Garbage-Western-Railway-ville."
1254,Just had to write to moan,"Just had to write to moan. Never complain to a company, but the service on the West Coast line back from Cornwall last night was absolutely appalling. Had to stand in dirty litter ridden train carriages nearly 2 hours... will never get the train again,."
1255,Bought an early ticket in advance,Bought an early ticket in advance - however arrived from airport much earlier. Decided to pay another 100 pounds for same ticket that would get me to destination 60mins early.
1256,Staff don’t like customers,Have been travelling; on GWR for many years and staff at station are becoming increasingly unfriendly. Caught the 11:57 London Paddington to Penzance on the 22/10 where one of the guards on platform 2 was being particularly cocky and sarcastic and did not bother to read the situation properly. He clearly has pre conceived negative ideas about customers to the point of shouting out after me when I told him not to be so rude. Not good.
1257,I don't know how they can justify such …,"I don't know how they can justify such high ticket prices when their trains are bogging. The toilets are stinking with pubes all over the seats, the carpets are sticky and the seats threadbare. Utterly ridiculous"
1258,This is the worst train line ever to …,This is the worst train line ever to exist! The customer service is shameful and disgraceful. Currently on a 2pm train to penzance from London. £80 ticket and having to stand squished in corridor as the train is over crowded. Secondly an unscheduled stop was made in reading to pick up more passengers. Meaning the train is delayed and also even more crowded. Absolutely disgusting. You are a horrific train line that is a money making disgace .  I whoever runs this shambles of a company goes bankrupt
1259,"There shoud be an option for ""no star""…DO BETTER GWR!! DO BETTER!!","There shoud be an option for ""no star"" rating or maybe rotten egg rating (seeing as rotten tomatoes is taken!!)."
1260,WHY HAS THIS COMPANY STILL NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED?,A load of crap! I’ve never been so insulted in my life!
1261,Be cautious in navigating GWR website with arrow keys,"My lesson (and take heed) is not to use arrow keys to navigate GWR's site; doing so changed my day of travel from 1 March to two weeks later, despite having actively selected the day I wished to travel.  I accept I made a mistake, but trying to rectify it took six phone calls a couple of hours struggling with their unstable website to navigate their refund process - only to be told I could have exchanged my tickets at the local station! The website is cumbersome; ability to make changes non existent; and a shockingly poor customer engagement experience. Shame."
1262,I went online to order 1 adult ticket…,I went online to order 1 adult ticket from Exeter to Paddington and 1 Senior citizen ticket including a Railcard. I clearly dropped down selection boxes and was sent 2 Senior citizen tickets. I called Customer support and was told I would have to cancel order... Wait 28 Days and get a refund. This would mean paying twice for tickets for this period. I could not afford this. Why should I pay it anyway.... It was their sites error. Will never use site again.
1263,Health and safety issue!,Another day when GWR can't deliver the service!
1264,I was planned to get on a train from reading to Bristol,"I was planned to get on a train from reading to Bristol, then the train was cancelled leaving me with an hour and an half wait and the on the next train we couldn’t even get a seat even though on the last train we paired Extra to reserve seats and we couldn’t get one, so we stood there with our bags for two hours, having to move for people getting off and just waiting and we can’t even get compensation as you have to know every single detail of your journey which is extremely hard and full of effort for what would probably be one free ride or even worse."
1265,I wouldn’t even give GWR a 1,I wouldn’t even give GWR a 1. I am a monthly commuter and pay the extautionate fairs and yet I am wondering what on Earth I am paying for? Especially with the increase! The 07:44 from Newport to Bristol is laughable. 5 carriages is a struggle but lately only 3 have been provided and the conditions on the carriage are unsafe and unacceptable with the amount of customers cramming in and people getting crushed. The 17:21 return journey is also equally as bad this time leaving us with 3 carriages as a standard and even worse 3 days a week there are only 2!! These are the busiest commuting times for this journey and they are just not being catered for. What will it take for you to change this service because clearly the price increase is doing nothing but extra for your pockets.
1266,Terrible new GWT trains,"The new GWT trains on the Bristol Bath to London line are shockingly bad. The seats seem to be modelled on Victorian school room desks - extremally hard. I have not taken a trip without seeing at least one passenger suffering from back pain. The toilets are filthy and half the size of the old ones, with no where to hang your coat or bag. The buffet car seems to have been abandoned. The quiet carriage is only labelled as such on the door, in small print. As such, most passengers in it are unaware and so the place is loud with no clear grounds that it shouldn’t be. The reservation system is unclear - you can only see if a seat is booked when squinting at a tiny digital display above the aisle. So useless if you’re looking through windows on a crowded platform trying to find a spare seat. A smaller point, but very ugly interiors. I’ve travelled GWR regularly for twenty years and I am utterly confused as to why they abandoned a previously good train design for these."
1267,Very bad,"This was my First ever experience with GWR and unfortunately it was Awful. I have nothing good to say about my trip from Portsmouth harbour to Bristol, apart from getting me there safely and on time there was nothing else good about this service. The train was very cold and very dirty, not to mention extremely dated. Not a comfortable journey - no leg room extremely cramped.  On top of this the tap in the toilet was broken so I couldn’t even wash my hands after using the bathroom. There was also no working WiFi as advertised. Would not recommend. Has a lot of catching up to do with other providers such as SWT."
1268,Already dreading morning commute,Already dreading morning commute.
1269,The ticket prices on GWR are …,"The ticket prices on GWR are astronomical, £76.60 walk up off peak return to Cardiff (2 hrs). Advance fares would be great if there were any available, but even a month before there are very slim pickings. Back in the day you could get advance fares easily but not any more. Amazing really that they're happy to have near empty trains rather than sell more reasonably priced tickets."
1270,"horrific experience, nationalisation can't come too soon","travelled to cornwall at the end of october 17 on a sunday... train stopped quite a long time at a particular station, then message given to passengers that there was an issue with the air con and the driver was fixing it.  then further updates given to the same tune over the next 50!! mins, during which several passengers got off (obviously experienced similar before!!)."
1271,Bristol to London,"Me and my fiance been traveling from Bristol to London on 14th of November 9:30am . And in train we got to know that they have a trolley with snacks and coffees or tea. In my situation I have sometimes to low blood pressure and coffee is my medicine to take massive headache off. So all journey takes about 1,50 minutes. After one hour train Manager Louise came to us to check the tickets and I asked when the trolley is coming, she answered and left. In about 10 minutes Louise came back to us with the coffee cup and saved my mood even without knowing why I need that coffee so much . GWT should be happy to have that kind of Manager. If there would be all team like that they would have amazing customer service. Thank you so much Louise."
1272,Too many days + high prices!,"Not a single time without a delay, absolutely chaotic. Price are too high for the given service. Not even seats available most of them...SO put more coaches on the busy routes!"
1273,Absolute disgusting customer service on …,"Absolute disgusting customer service on the phone. After ringing up to ask about a certain booking, the woman on the other end of the phone wouldn’t listen to me or even try to help. She then, simply hung up the phone while I was talking. I tried ringing back and she just put me on hold and no one picked up the phone."
1274,customer service,i complained to GWR about the fact that the ticket office at our local station closed early and there was no instructions about buying tickets on the train to reassure my 17 year old son.  The only posters (2 large ones) concerned the dire consequences of what would happen if you didn't have a ticket.  It took 3 emails to get them to address my question and eventually this is what they said
1275,Great customer service :-),Great customer service :-) An employee went above and beyond the call of duty to assist my children for which I'm very grateful :-) Highly recommended
1276,Dire service,Dire service. Got on a train the other day and even the driver and ticket inspector didn’t know it was cancelled. Let everyone on the train and only realised they should have been vacating the train once the passengers told them. The guards on the platform claimed they were putting on bus replacement service...which never turned up either. Just one example of many similar occurrences.
1277,Absolutely dreadful train service..,"Absolutely dreadful train service... I am regular commuter between Paddington and Tilehurst and must say that 90% trains are cancelled or delayed (especially between Reading and Tilehurst). I am absolutely fed up with their ridiculous excuses (train is delayed due to driver has not showed up :-) ). and compenstation policy or to be more specific a lack of it. The train must be delayed an hour or more to get the fraction of the ticket price.... I am is deep shock how UK Goverment let them doing their business... South West Trains pays compensation even for 15 minutes delay, maybe that is the reason why their care about their timetable. Do not understand why GW has some special privilages regarding their compensation policy?"
1278,Lies and more lies,"Train delayed in July so missed connection. Sent in claim for delayed journey. Told a series of lies. Refused to let me speak to a manager. Complete lack of customer service or empathy. 3 months later, frustrated, angry and out of pocket, and GWR refused my request for even a small gesture of goodwill."
1279,Please nationalise,"I constantly get refused on to these trains due to space issues, and not once have I been successful in using there reduced ticket procedure."
1280,ME AGAIN,"Here I am waiting for the 0705 from Ealing to Oxford and ONE MINUTE before the train is due.. surprise, surprise ITS DELAYED."
1281,A further complaint from below,A further complaint from below. I had a delayed train in august and applied for compensation. It's now October and I'm still awaiting my cheque. I was told to ring back his week to see  where my cheque was. Apparently I  will get it by 16 October. Thus us two months after the incident. On the phone itiday I complained about making a wasted phone call having been told to ring back by gvr. The response was 'thats fine'. Well GWR it's not done to waste customer time.
1282,"40 minutes delayed, no delay repay","40 minutes delayed, missed connection, total journey took 2 hours longer because of it. NO delay repay"
1283,Good customer assistant,"Good customer assistant, there are some problems regarding signals that can be corrected."
1284,Always they have problems a,Always they have problems and signals failure
1285,Andrew the customer assistant at London …,"Andrew the customer assistant at London Victoria 26th Sep 17 was very helpful, kind and aided me when I was lost. Much appreciated"
1286,Issued tickets wrongly + Customer service takes ages to respond,"Bought tickets facing direction of travel and they issued the other way around. Raised a complaint and they got back to me 20 days after, wow! Even though , they requested more information (that I had already provided) and asked for more 20 days to get back. This company is a JOKE!"
1287,June 2017 Delayed over an hour on a …,June 2017 Delayed over an hour on a train from Wales to Paddington- submitted a claim form for compensation -Its now mid September and STILL nothing - just emails asking for information I have already given - address and postcode - no explanation and no apology - strangely Southern rail - which has a terrible reputation - paid up in 2 weeks for a delay on their train on the same day
1288,Disgrace,Quick question? Will any of your trains actually bother turning up on time? Or can you even be bothered anymore? The single handed most dreadful service I have ever used. Tried to head Brighton for the weekend with the wife and kids and the train just didn't bother to turn up. No compensation. No apology. No Excuses! Weekend ruined. AVOID!!!!!!!
1289,Took me three and a half hours to get …,"Took me three and a half hours to get home today, after every single possible train I had to get was cancelled. Thanks GWR possibly the single worst railway company in existence, have had exactly the same issue with them before. Overpriced and absolute garbage. Would highly suggest you use another service."
1290,Seat reservation computer said to have …,Seat reservation computer said to have broken down - this was on the 1703 from Paddington to Penzance on a Thursday evening late January. What a time to choose! First class was heaving full and the rest of the train impossible to find a seat. Guard said things would improve after Pewsey (who lives there?). He was right and there were seats but by then others had taken everyone else’s reserved seats. Chaos! Not a way to run a railway. Bring back Brunel.
1291,Inefficient,"Every weekend it’s pretty impossible traveling to Swansea from London. Planned closure, crew shortage, staff not going to work... but they still charge you £90. Life is easy without competitors"
1292,Usually a good service,"Suprised to see so many negative reviews on here. I get GWR from West Drayton to Ealing Broadway (and back) regularly and have found the service to be reliable on the whole. The 8:10am from West Drayton would usually turn up early and depart at 8:10am on the dot. Of the times where there have been delays, most have not been for longer than 5 minutes and longer delays only in truly exceptional circumstances. Also trains are clean, comfortable, and I can usually get a seat even at peak hours."
1293,How they get away with charging those …,How they get away with charging those eye watering fares and still have the audacity to run an extremely shoddy train service is beyond me.  I suppose with no other competition and no other choice they seem to do what they want.
1294,Simply the worst been on this pile of …,"Simply the worst been on this pile of crap service for too long computing to and from school. Always late, over priced, awful service it's quiet literally the worst."
1295,If only I could give 0 stars...,"Literally the worst train service I have ever been on, and that’s saying something from someone who has been on trains in Sri Lanka and Burma! What do GWR promise? A reliable way for me and my fellow commuters to get to wherever we need to go everyday. However, the trains are nearly always late, they are overpriced for what they are, and they are not comfortable. If you can avoid GWR, do it at any chance. Trust me, you will have dodged a bullet!"
1296,Can't remember the last time I got a …,"Can't remember the last time I got a local train on time, probably talking six months and I get a train most weeks. Overpriced and a terrible service. The express service is ok but local services are shocking."
1297,This week my various GWR trains have …,This week my various GWR trains have been over an hour late or cancelled.
1298,Unreliable,"I thought I'd take the kids for a day out on the train.  Such a shame GWR are allowed to run a service.  The trains to Bath were all cancelled when we arrived at the station... so we changed our plans and went the other direction.  5 minutes later they uncancelled the trains to Bath.  too late, I now had tickets for the other direction.  then my train was delayed by 5, 8, 12, 9, 6 and 8 minutes before arriving 15 minutes late.  And then no seats.  Wish I'd driven.... Diabolically unreliable service.  won't bother again"
1299,Terrible service overall,Terrible service overall
1300,Dishonest. Questionable integrity.,VERY questionable integrity and very poor professionalism. NOT the way to run a company :-(
1301,If I could give 0 stars I would.,"I don't understand what the issue is, you buy a ticket for a seat and none are ever available. Also, its quicker to fly from london to new york than go from London to Truro by train. Furthermore there's a 'minimum spend' of £25per person in the ""restaurant"" so you can't even sit there and have a coffee while you wait for a seat to free up. It's dispicable."
1302,Late most of the time or canceled.,Late most of the time or canceled.
1303,Customer service was left behind on the platform at London Paddington,"I returned from LHR after travelling 8 hours with my 4 year old to hop on a train in Paddington to Exeter with a pre-booked ticket. 90 minutes in, the train manager told me I was on the train an hour earlier than my ticket stated and I was charged a full fare for the trip. When I told him it was a genuine mistake and I didn't think it was reasonable to charge me like that on a Sunday, it became apparent there was no compassion, empathy or understanding and I was forced to pay up. The train manager did not want to provide his full details, but I told him I would file a complaint as the experience was rather distressing for both me and my 4 year old. I sent GWR a detailed e-mail and sent my tickets and a complaint form, only to follow-up a week later to hear that 'ticket policy is the policy'. No refund... Ah well, so be it then...From now onwards I will consider taking the train to London as a last option over car or bus...I was amazed that customer service seems to feature very low on GWR's list. Many times I have had to contend boarding a train without seating available, many times I was confronted with massive delays and never I complained. For once I made a genuine mistake and the ""GWR rules' got enforced without flinching."
1304,Major improvements required,On outward and onward journey from Paddington to Cornwall WC's not functioning. Seats extremely uncomfortable and space per passenger at table 4 seats unacceptable. Journey started at St Austell and first announcement that there was restaurant car came at 1.45 - not much use as most people had already eaten their lunches. Very small area for luggage and totally inadequate for number of people on train - luggage stacked up in exit doorways from train. Difficult to negotiate and can't be safe to block exit doors. One Good point:  Train delayed but train manager answered all queries and helped with onward journeys.
1305,Awful service- avoid!,"I was delayed for over an hour, and they told me the delay was only for two minutes. There is no one to complain to. I phoned up several times, and they kept trying to dissuade me from pursuing it, yet would not deal with the complaint. I have not received any apology or compensation for the fact I had to keep phoning. Awful service, I will not be using them again."
1306,Nightmare return train journey Cornwall/Kent …,"Purchased return to Cornwall from Kent (not first class). On way out  GWR train so crowded people were having to sit in the aisles - so no access to either toilet or purchase of a drink (4hr+ journey). On way back, all the seats appears to have been previously reserved - although many people simply didn't turn up/use the reserved seats. This produced 'seat rage' as people getting on saw others in ""their"" seats and thought they weren't going to get 'their seat' - everyone was British and gave up seats when asked, but what a carry-on. They don't seem to reserve seats like this on Kent/London trains, probably because it doesn't work in practice! Next time I'll give up on my 'green' credentials and just drive - half the cost and less than a quarter of the hassle."
1307,Uninformed Customer Services,"The refund form has 8 boxes for the reference number, but the number on the ticket has 10 digits."
1308,"Not perfect, But getting there","Not perfect, but getting there and getting better."
1309,New rolling stock useless for commuters....IMO,"Just used a GWR train...which has the latest carriages. Like all other train companies the design is Not fit for commuting. Tables are too narrow, (so you can't put 2 laptops back to back), as the are so narrow if you do use laptop it is too far away to be used comfortably..."
1310,God awful,God awful.
1311,Consistently late,"Consistently late, overcrowded, cancelled services."
1312,Still waiting for a refund claimed in …,Still waiting for a refund claimed in early May - although looking at other posts here I'm probably being a little impatient. Saw a piece in Guardian Money about a delayed refund and GWR moved quickly then and added 2 free 1st Class tickets as compensation for delay. Can't wait for my free tickets- might even get a seat for a change from Bath to Paddington!
1313,Great staff,"Staff were helpful, polite and friendly."
1314,Web site DIRE!,"Interesting that the text number given, to Marta on16 th May, and thus for the message I sent has been returned, undeliverable, 4 times."
1315,Terrible,"Terrible, couldn't care less about er well they call us customers. Commute everyday and have no choice, nightmare and stress :("
1316,Poor service.,"I use their service on daily basis, at least twice a day for 2 years now so feel no rage while writting this review, just got used to it. I was able to get to work and back at majority of times, but often wet to the skin due to overfilled platform on rainy day or due to extremely high temperature in cars during hot days. Front line crew members do their best, but their approach cannot replace exploited equipment and poor logistics. Probably worst value for money you can get."
1317,1 Stars is too high for them.,"If there was less than one stars I would go lower, the trains are 10 minutes late every single day there is no point keeping it at a certain time just for the 1/10 chance that it might arrive on time because it barely does. At least make it for the time it usually comes so I don't have to wait ages at a station. Update your times to something more realistic or get yourselves together and provide at least a tiny bit better service it would save me and a lot of other people a lot of troubles."
1318,Unacceptable refund policy,Unacceptable refund policy
1319,A thoroughly third world railway,"Monday 19 June. Asked to leave train at Bristol as it had developed a fault (I can only deduce this as two guys in orange jump suits came and went as we stood in temperatures over 30C). Got on next train which was so full many passengers were left behind. Friday morning 23 June. Train to Bristol Parkway 20 minutes late so GWR terminated it at Temple Meads. Asked to change trains again. Next train ran late late too. Friday afternoon 23 June. Asked to leave train at Bristol as it had developed a fault (no men in orange jump suits this time but the rolling stock is over 40 years old...) Next train heading home was the worst overcrowding I have ever experienced in 45 years of train travel. No apology. No explanation. No refund due as I was just under 1 hour late at my destination. So, bounced off a train 3 times in one week. Over 90 minutes late and verging on heat stroke - is that OK GWR?"
1320,OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE,We would Iike to let you know about the great customer service received from Chris who was stationed on the customer service desk at Paddington Station by Platform 1 on Monday 19th June. He was absolutely amazing - saved our day and our holiday - we just wanted to say a big thank you to him and acknowledge the help we received.
1321,A truly incompetent company,"I have to use GWR services 5 days a week. Even though the train ride between Bristol and Bath takes just over 10 minute, I rarely have the privilege of having a service on time. You will hear a LOT of 'we're sorry to announce' that they're missing train crews, that they have signaling problems, and the list goes on. The journey between Bristol and Bath costs an extortionate £7.60, which turns out to be the most expensive short train journey in the U.K. And if you want to get a refund, hope that you're train was delayed by more than an hour, which happens quite regularly anyway. At least I've got time on my hands to review their atrocious service."
1322,I went to Reading Station yesterday to …,"I went to Reading Station yesterday to renew my Network railcard. I was met with astonishing rudeness. The lady who served me said she's a fast server, and if I had gone to another window she could have served 3 customers in the time she took with me, instead of doing nothing while I filled out the form. It took me 2 minutes to complete. I was going to book tickets as well, but I was so put off I didn't. Unbelievable rudeness."
1323,The service is absolutely horrendous,"The service is absolutely horrendous, and they don't care at all for having a horrible service. While the ticket price is soaring through the roof, the service seems stagnant if not has been declining. I have very little hope in GWR on improving their service."
1324,The new app is so sxxt I ended up …,"The new app is so sxxt I ended up driving to my destination as the app kept telling me I could walk then catch a bus a tram a rocket everything but the train I was looking for..... all my previous ticket info disappeared, what stupid Txxt at GWR thought this was a good idea, the old app wasn't broken so why the F mess with it , the AA DID EXACTLY the same , updated a really good app to crap , well done to the IT nerds at both companies!!!!!!"
1325,Avoid getting yourself in refund situation and don't use the app.,Avoid using app and try not to get yourself in situation of needing a refund.
1326,New app,The new version of the app is just hopeless [look at the comments on iStore for full details] - how on earth was this allowed to replace a simple but fully functional older version.  Very poor management.
1327,The new app is awful!,The new app is awful!! As mentioned before whoever has made this for you needs to give you a refund.
1328,"New iOS  ticket app, what a shocker.","Have to voice this, their new app is shocking.  What a downgrade.  The simplicity and user friendliness of the old app was fantastic, this has been thrown away by the new app.  What a shame, time to return to using the ticket office at the station."
1329,Train reading to pensance,"Train reading to pensance. First class. Near 250 quid single. Train late of course. And we all know, compared to continental trains - about 200 per cent cheaper - there is no restaurant, no cafe, no pub. Instead: 2 croiscants, an apple and a bacon sandwich - old not fresh - and thats for the whole train. Now 2 hrs into the journey buffet is closed, no trolley service, announcements inaudible due to technical fault. No newspapers. Why on earth travel first class ? For last 2 hrs aircon on full speed, no heating, desperately cold. Numerous complaints from passengers just receive a shrug. Learning that a. There is not electricity b. no heat c.no staff and d. No food on  board. Train manager says "" its the usual crap mate"". Seems, on top of everything else, we are severely delayed by over an hour"
1330,Great customer service,"Great customer service, friendly conductors and after using busses for ages I am glad I now use GWR trains"
1331,Costumer service lies about refund or …,Costumer service lies about refund or does not respond.
1332,Terrible customer service from GWR,Terrible customer service from GWR.
1333,Terrible website,"Terrible website - spent 40 minutes waiting for the pages to load.  Almost gave up, but lack of choice means I have to persevere."
1334,"Stone-age IT (Website, App, Contact Centre)","GWR Website and App are by far the worst services I have to use. I guess the lack of competition allow them to afford such bad services. App glitch double booking could only be solved by sending unused tickets by mail (by mail, for crying out loud!) and wait 30 days (30 days!!!) to get a refund. I've made a mistake using the over complicated website and ended up losing my ticket (cheaper than paying the £10 fee). Come to the 21st Century GWR! Btw, this is not a review about staff, it is all about the Website and App."
1335,Avoid GWR m-tickets and GWR Customer support,"The customer sales telephone teams and those at ticket desk such as Taunton are very unhelpful, here is an example. I recently bought a electronic ticket (m-ticket) using the GWR app and now need to amend it. I told that I can not amend it even if I pay the amend fee, however the conditions of m-ticket clearly state they can be amended.   After a number of unpleasant phone calls and emails and web chat on their Facebook page, I am now told that to change my electronic ticket (m-ticket) I have to complete a paper form, send in the post and apply for a refund, and then I have to re-book my m-tickets."
1336,horrible service,"staff are rude, and not helpful."
1337,"Complaint logged, no contact for 2 months, now lost my complaint !!",After a train journey was delayed by over 2 hours  I filled in the online form attaching my ticket requesting a compensation payment. After 3-4 weeks I phoned requesting an update only to be told that there was a delay in dealing with these requests and I should phone back later. 2 months after the delay I phoned again only to be told that they couldn't find the original form and asked me to forward the auto response I had got from them to the customer service team so they could look into it. Looks like I have gone to the back of the queue and got nowhere.
1338,Significant decline in standards on east coast route,"They’ve taken over the east coast route that Virgin Trains used to operate. What a shocking decline in the standard of service provided. Over booked, far shorter trains, shabby, dirty trains, yet same price or more expensive.  Why on earth have they been given the route over Virgin Trains?"
1339,"Grand central rail, don't do it!!!","Omg on a train right now from kings cross to York absolutely packed out with people from other cancelled trains and broken air conditioning in 28 searing heat, everyone's reserved seating go e to pot! Buffet cart closed, no one offering free water to elderly or children, I'm never travelling with this train service again! Disgusting,  staff that I've seen which is 1 so far, don't want to know, very rude horrible experience"
1340,No seats !!,Travel from London to York return. Cheap but no seats! My daughter is 12 years old and suffers from anxiety issues. On the way from London to York she and her elder sister had to sit on the floor by the toilet. t’s really a running joke that train companies sell tickets but don’t reserve seats for its customers. Let’s be clear about this : Rail companies are making profits from hard working people who are forced to stand hour after hour on packed trains . If you cannot provide the seats don’t sell the tickets. Finally I do not wish to hear the tiresome ill judged ideological arguments about ‘consumer choice’ ; they are too weak to be posted here. Grand Central need to get this sorted out immediately !
1341,Travelled from London to Thirsk,"Travelled from London to Thirsk. First class tickets AND WE STOOD ALL THE WAY THERE! £150 return and NO SEATS! Scandalous. The aircon didn't work and the stewards were surly and did not supply drinks and snacks as they are supposed to... instead eating the snacks themselves! A passenger eventually found cool drinks and distributed them. The train home terminated at York. The worst railway journey I've ever undertaken - and one of the most expensive. We are awaiting a decision on refund/compensation. Meanwhile, avoid like the plague!"
1342,Travelled from Hartlepool to York…,Travelled from Hartlepool to York return today in the hot summer weather. No air con on both journeys and this also happened a month ago too.
1343,Dangerously full trains,"They never have enough seats for their weekend, bank holiday or Christmas services, I have had to sit on the floor of these trains more than I've sat on a seat."
1344,Grand Central’s lack of cooperation and intelligent use of discretion.,Tonight First class Virgin ticket from York to Amberley West Sussex leaving at the scheduled time of 7:32pm.  Virgin train delayed by 30 minutes so catching my last connecting train at Victoria to Amberley is now extremely unlikely. Grand Central guard Andrea and her platform manager refused to use discretion in these exceptional circumstances and allow Virgin ticket holders onto their 7:11pm departing train. Andrea commented ‘ we don’t get any revenue by letting you on our train’.
1345,First class traveller sometimes using…,First class traveller sometimes using Virgin for once a week return trip to London.
1346,Shockingly poor,Shockingly poor. I avoid these trains like the plague.
1347,Regularly grand central traveller,Regularly use grand central trains and would recommend for services to Yorkshire and North East. Refurbished trains are an improvement. Customer service usually good though sometimes struggles when things go wrong.
1348,3 trains a day..,3 trains a day... Didn't mention that when I bought the return ticket London to Leeds. Scum - trains are dirty and run down.
1349,First time I've used Grand Central,"First time I've used Grand Central. Very impressed, lovely clean trains on time and staff are very helpful. I will be using this service from now on instead of Virgin."
1350,How times have changed!,"How times have changed. I left a glowing five star review for Grand Central on 3 August 2017. Since then, things have gone downhill."
1351,1) Overbooked train,1) Overbooked train
1352,Awful service,Really Terrible service.
1353,Not a pleasant experience,I booked this ticket online but knew nothing about Grand Central.
1354,"Luxurious, Direct Travel!!","I have always travelled with Grand Central to London from my base in West Yorkshire. Firstly, because I can travel direct - without having to change trains. Secondly, the trains are clean and well-taken care of. The seats are comfortable too. Free wifi on the train is an additional bonus!"
1355,I was traveling to London,I was traveling to London. Journey took two hours. Exhausting! Coach was freezing cold!  Expected much more comfort from my very expensive ticket fare!
1356,Terible customer service & date protection breach,On a recent journey a member of there staff asked us to complete a survey as part of that they asked to see the ticket to make a note of it.  I'm positive that by accident they didn't give the return ticket back. No big problem we had the reservation email seat number and could prove we bought it.  We even offered to go with a conductor the seat we had bought with the email confirming this was my seat with proof of my identity but we got told no. we got told it was are fault for loosing the ticket.  When I contacted them after through web support we got told we lost the ticket so it was are fault they just wouldn't listen to make matters worse one of the replies was not for me it was for another customer with there details and complaints reference on dealing with there issue.   I will never use them again I don't mind the lady loosing the ticket mistakes happen but when something goes wrong its how they deal with it that matters.  Shocking service shocking attitude and its obvious we didn't matter
1357,I changed jobs to avoid Southern Rail,"I literally switched jobs to avoid Southern Rail’s awful, extortionate service. On the frequent instances when my train was delayed by hours or cancelled, the compensation scheme gatekeepers denied any claim I put forward without consideration. Once, my train was cancelled and the replacement bus service had a driver who quote, “got lost”, and drove us and the other passengers to a City an hours drive from our intended destination. Southern Rail is an embarrassment to Britain and a testament to the pernicious effect that the privatisation of natural monopolies can have on the quality of consumer services."
1358,Bad decision to amend timetable for local London services,Cannot see any reason why they insist on running an amended timetable for services between Dartford/Slade Green/Barnehurst and London when other train operators were running more normal services during the few days of snow. They may indeed have had  big problems further out into Kent but how would this affect the local London services that don't go further out than Dartford?
1359,Always awful,I dread every journey with Southern. I have become accustomed to delayed and cancelled trains. Virgin please buy this route.
1360,Poor decision to remove refreshments…,Poor decision to remove refreshments trolley on longer journeys.
1361,Useless Southern Rail,For sure the worst and most unreliable rail service I've ever known!!
1362,Awful train service by Southern Rail,"Travelled today only a short distance from St Denys station to Southampton Central with my daughter, her baby and toddler son who is mad about trains so it was supposed to be a treat for him. Train delayed on way there and our return journey was terrible. Train indicated as late over the the tannoy but showing on time on the display board. Then suddely passengers were advised to go to another platform. Everyone hurriedly did so including ourselves only to find out that the train was then cancelled again. Then the next train was late and again we were redirected to another platform but that didn’t arrive either. On asking about the next available train, an attendant gave us the wrong information. Finally spoke with the Station Msnager who did offer to send us home in a taxi free of charge but my daughter didn’t want to risk travelling in a car with a baby and toddler and no car seats. So we spent almost 10 pounds in the cafe waiting for another half an hour and finally got back an hour and a half later to travel a distance of one stop witn a journey time of 10 minutes normally. And it was supposed to have been a treat for the toddler. Luckily he likes watching trains but waiting for an hour and a half on a mucky cold station isn’t my idea of fun. No wonder people prefer their cars."
1363,Everytime I have tried to use a train…,Everytime I have tried to use a train to go to Southampton it has been delayed for 40 minutes or more. The cost of this ticket was 35 pounds which is very expensive for such a bad service .
1364,Tickets are never checked,Tickets are never checked. I get a train 4 times a week for the past 5 months and my ticket had only been checked twice in this time I’ve wasted load of money on train tickets that have not been checked. Trains are always late 90% of the time. Unreliable and a waste of time. I now get the bus as tickets are always checked and cheaper
1365,"Terrible service, always late and delay reclaim doesn’t work!","Awful service, trains are always late or cancelled for silly reasons. Old infrastructure slow trains, one track lines. Some investment definitely required!"
1366,They are never on time and their …,They are never on time and their solution to all delays is just to cancel  the services. They seriously dont give a damn about their customers even knowing we are paying their ridiculous wages. Never been in so much stress in my life. So painful to go to work everyday!!!!!
1367,Horrific,"Horrific, awful organisation, constant delayed trains. Terrible customer service, the list  goes on and on.. If they didn't have a monopoly on overpriced transport nobody would touch them with a bargepole."
1368,Sub third world standard of service,"How do we, the suffering users of this horrendous business do something about them? In any competitive environment customers would have gone elsewhere and the business would have gone bust."
1369,"Always canceled and delayed, be careful if you travel in a tight schedule!","Amazing, trains are always canceled and delayed. I have a 2h delay on my journey from Gatwick airport du to southern trains. Wrote a complaint for a refund of my ticket and receive a response confirming my 15-29min delay... Seriously? who is in charge of reviewing the complaints??? And of course, there is no contact details on the email."
1370,Appalling Service.,I really don’t know how they manage it but every service seems to be delayed or cancelled! If you need to be anywhere I important and you have to take a train I would make sure you take an earlier train that is necessary.
1371,Train confirmed as on time - delayed - cancelled,"Train confirmed as on time, changed to delayed, then cancelled all within 10 minutes, what they didn't know the train wasn't running on the hour 3 times from  1pm to 3pm. Ticket office closed, guy on gate unhelpful to say the least. Used to have great people who helped you but that's all gone.Tried to get refund via Trainline, joke. Put me through to Southern where the customer service was non existent. Eventually they have agreed after I go to post office with tickets and pay for recorded delivery for something that wasn't my fault.  2 hours on the phone over 2 days. Watch this space money not back yet."
1372,Constant delays and disruption,"Constant delays, would be interesting to see statistics based on peak hours, i.e. commute to and from work, would bet it's appalling!  Had to get home as son had an accident. About a 20min delay (which I consider lucky in hindsight) which then meant my train then ran fast to Sutton instead of stopping at my usual stop.  Poor service is obviously not tied to fare prices as this went up to around £45 a week zone 1-4.  Would assume this is also the case if reviewing executive bonuses of Southern staff.  Just wished I was not at the mercy of this rail company who have a track record amongst customers and on the ground staff of disappointment, disruption, bad service, and ultimately based on this, failure at all fronts..."
1373,Disappointing service compared to Virgin trains.,I was half way on my journey when there was an announcement made saying that we had to be on the 4 front carriages of where we wanted to get to our destination - Portsmouth. The trouble was I could barely hear what was being said as it was too quiet and muffled with lots of noise in the background and they spoke so quickly that I didn't get a word of it! What was worse was I couldn't even find a conductor on board! Fortunately one of the passengers then were able to advise. Secondly they don't do refreshments. They could at least offer tea and coffee. Last but not least they don't have power points so you can use your laptop or phone. For today's trains definitely of poor standard. Virgin trains are much better.
1374,This 'service' is a total joke,This 'service' is a total joke. Except it's not funny if I lose my job as a teacher because I can't get to school on time despite leaving Epsom at 6am for an 8.30 start. A journey that takes 45 mins in a car. Staff couldn't care less but that's probably because they know that Southern are crap. They overcharge regularly. Was recently charged £168 for a journey that should have been £121. Complaints procedure is rubbish. They take 10 days to even respond. National Rail respond immediately and are really helpful. This company needs to be stripped of its franchise immediately. Chris Grayling lives in Epsom but is the worst Transport Secretary ever. Sack him too.
1375,Disgrace,"The only reason I can imagine for the fare increase is to pay for the blindfolded drunk chimpanzee on a swivel chair randomly throwing darts at half a tea stained timetable on a wall in one of your offices,as this seems to be how you pick what time trains arrive at random stations. A disgrace of a service, all involved should be sacked and shamed for allowing this farce to continue for so long."
1376,Does not even deserve one star,"Does not even deserve one star, I can't think of anything less reliable than their ability to follow their timetable."
1377,Just endured yet another delayed,"Just endured yet another delayed , 1.5 hour journey to travel what is a 20 minute journey . The constantly failing service from Victoria to Portsmouth harbour .two consecutive trains  cancelled at Chichester , a weekly /often daily occurence . Nasty dirty trains , but miraculously southwestern trains still running along same price of track when changed at Havant . Southern rail ..you are a disgrace ..and I cannot help but notice that the guards that seem to so furiously  wanting to keep there jobs , something I would normally support , are always completely invisible on days like these . Yet on operational journeys they are everywhere ? Funny that . Horrible , third world , crappy dirty , rubbish service , and systematically destroying peoples livelyhoods which from tomorrow you will be charging me an five percent increase . DISGRACEFUL"
1378,After being charged excess for not …,"After being charged excess for not  having my Senior Railcard (08ZME1092626746) with me (my fault) on 9th May, 2018,travelling from Leeds to York  and submitting an application (00873) for reimbursement of the fine on 10th May at Dewsbury Train Station, as advised by the conductor, which is 28 miles from where I live, I found that I could have submitted my application at any train station and preferably at the station where I purchased my ticket, which was Skipton only 7 miles away."
1379,Currently onboard,"Currently onboard,  travelling to Manchester from Chester-Le-Street. As i was travelling first class i didn't make a point of purchasing any refreshments on way to the train station, fatal error, ive had a coffee but my only choice of food was a slice of cake or some cheddar dips, at £35 a seat i think that's appauling, im hungry so im happy to get my purse out and pay for something and make sure i use Virgin in future but there is no actual food to purchase! Crisps or chocolate are my 2 paying options, allthough the carrige is quite and comfortable and staff are very polite and friendly thats where it ends, after reading some online reviews before i posted mine it does seem though i was lucky to get the coffee, wont be using this service again."
1380,The worst ever.,"Terrible. Booked a train to Edinburgh to find out 3 weeks later it was cancelled. Booked an alternative, no seat reservations, and had to change at Glasgow and go across town to get the Edinburgh. The train arrived at Preston on a Saturday, with only 3 coaches. We were crammed in and had to stand to Penrith. I am 65. All the seats had reserved signs on and were full. We found out that none were reserved and TE put reserved tickets on so that no one would sit in them to save on cleaning. Disgusting. I wrote a complaint with the promise of a reply in 5 days. Guess what. Nothing 10 days later. We returned home on A virgin train with reserved seat which cost a third of the TE tickets and it was direct. Won't use TE again. Avoid at all cost. Not to be trusted."
1381,I would dearly love to give less than…,I would dearly love to give less than one star.   A nightmare journey from Manchester to York in April.  I made a complaint after the journey and am still waiting for a response.  No toilets available on the train.  The train was late due to having toilet stops along its journey!  The management didnt take the train out of service and left the guard on the train to have to explain to passengers.   When I chased up a tesponse in early May  I was told the delays in responding were due to the snow.  When I asked what snow had to do with a response.  I was told the company was still responding to delays in March due to snow!   I will never travel wirh this company again.   Avoid like the plague.
1382,First class=third class,"The staff there were sluggish. The Spanish woman working there talked in her phone all the way from York to Manchester Airport. It was loud and horrible-and as a person who speaks Spanish, I cannot say enough how much I would rather not listen to one woman's loud family problems when I travel on first class."
1383,Purchased a first class return ticket…,Purchased a first class return ticket from Manchester to Leeds. No seats available for return journey. Complained to guard who advised to contact TP Express for a refund which I did and unfortunately never received a reply.
1384,Purchased a First Class Ticket in…,"Purchased a First Class Ticket in advance Sheffield - Manchester, no seats were  available in either first class or std class in this  overcrowded train, had to stand in the luggage area.  Complaining to the Company is a waste of time and effort with their negative derisory reply. It is time we had a different organisations to run  our public transport system"
1385,Absolute rubbish service,"Absolute rubbish service! Unfortunately, I have to commute to work daily using their services and it's just beyond reasonable. They always delay or cancel their services at the last minute, there's always some or the other problem with their trains and getting your refund back is just a never ending battle."
1386,A terrible terrible service if you’re…,A terrible terrible service if you’re travelling at peak times which is when of course you have to pay a premium to travel. The trains rarely arrive on time and are massively overcrowded which could be solved by simply adding carriages.
1387,A disgrace,"A disgrace. Trains are constantly delayed causing missed connections and ridiculously overcrowded during work commuting hours. Trying to deal with customer services to get a refund for delays is awful. They have policies to deliberately complicate the process and avoid repayment. If you do manage to get this after months of trying they insist on sending a cheque in the hope that you won't cash it, as opposed to simply refunding to the card you purchased the ticket with. I asked if I could buy my tickets by cheque and I can't apparently lol."
1388,Great service and comfortable trains.,Great service and comfortable trains.
1389,"Reasonable prices, good service","First class is very spacious, free wireless internet, free food and hot drinks, food is reasonably nice. Staff very friendly."
1390,Won’t be travelling by train again!,"Bought tickets with seat reservations this week to travel from Leeds to Scarborough and from Leeds to Newcastle this week. We had requested forward facing seats as my partner is affected by motion sickness. However our reserved seats were rear facing, not what we had requested. When we complained we received nothing but a stock reply that didn’t address the issue we raised. Very disappointed in the service and the response. Only travelling by train as our car had broken down."
1391,First Class is a disgrace.,Manchester to Glasgow.
1392,"Lost ticket, no help from company","I booked a ticket online with home delivery. Unfortunately I lost the paper ticket before travelling and I immediately contacted the customer service (both phone and email) to seek assistance. Even if I had a booking reference and confirmation email, they didn't issue a copy of the ticket or didn't even give me the chance to collect from a ticket machine. According to them, I had to buy a new full price ticket even if I had evidence of my reservation. They tried to scare me mentioning a possible fine on the train if trying to use my email reservation. I decided to get on the train with no paper ticket anyway and the ticket inspector was kind enough to accept my booking email as a proof of the ticket. Phone and online customer service was very unhelpful, it looks like this company doesn't care a lot about customers. Thumb up for the ticket inspector which used his common sense."
1393,I purchased a return ticket through the…,"I purchased a return ticket through the tpexpress.co.uk website a week or so before I intended to travel from Preston to Leeds on the 3rd, March. Due to snow many if not all trains were cancelled or severely delayed between Manchester and Leeds and the advice was not to travel. I therefore decided to cancel my trip on the 2nd, March a day before I was intending to travel. I hadn't collected my tickets from the station."
1394,Woefully incompetent,"Woefully incompetent, I opened a complaint in November and it still hasn't been resolved the following March. Each time I respond I go back into a 20 day queue, then each time Transpennine Express respond to me they don't read the previous correspondence and so have no understanding of the context or previous actions and comments. I've given up. Will do anything I can to avoid spending my money with them in future."
1395,On Thursday 1 March and travelling from…,"On Thursday 1 March and travelling from Scarborough to Newcastle via York; a kind conductor namely Steve who was working on the said train, want above and beyond to help me and others travelling on this train.  The weather was horrendous and due to snow many trains had been delayed or cancelled, but Steve kindly made sure we knew our next connection times and even want as far as to make sure we caught out train.  A true gentleman and highly deserving of some recognition - he clearly loves his job and I personally wish him every success for the future."
1396,Clean trains with conductors going …,Clean trains with conductors going through the carriage.  Ideal for local journeys.  First class carriage is a bit more limited / smaller than larger trains but this is never normally full and they give a very good service.
1397,Horrible customer service,Horrible customer service!
1398,Disgraceful service for exorbitant ticket price!,"Regularly use TPE to commute to/from work and am continuously appalled at the poor standard of service - regularly late/delayed and frequently the service only has two carriages instead of 4 on a peak hour service (Liverpool-Norwich service) resulting in the train being standing room only when it arrives on the platform at Warrington.  In recent months, there have been instances when the train has left passengers stranded on the platform because it was already overcrowded."
1399,the day we do not have delays in the…,"the day we do not have delays in the SWR train, we will have to celebrate it."
1400,Super expensive,I think highway robbery is less scandalous if I look at their pricing. At this cost they could lay down tracks from gold or give you a Jacuzzi ride with Thai massage...
1401,Delays and hardly a Repay!,"Was delayed in Bournemouth for over 9 hours! with no information on when the trains would be back up and running why they weren't running and no way provided to get home. everyone was stuck at the station they didn't provide food or a drink, nothing. one lady actually pass out from standing so long and the paramedics had to be called, when I finally got home and contacted customer support, they only have me half my ticket price back! And acted unaware to the fact that the train was delayed in the first place. By the way can they make there forms that you have to fill in when you are trying to get your money back easier to find online, it was nearly impossible. Oh and don't forget it takes them 6 months to reply to you, so don't expect your money (or half of it) back any time soon."
1402,Rude,"Rude, High - handed, standard phrased answers to specific complaints, if you repeat your complaint they failed to answer - an this goes all the way to the Chief Executive.  A totally useless organisation who treat their customers worse than cattle."
1403,I think there are two threads…,I think there are two threads complaining about SWR.  It may make sense to consolidate this one and the longer one against SouthWest Trains (which is probably unfair to this franchise) as it isnt them anymore!  The other thread has more complaints.
1404,If there was any other way to travel...,I used to love trains.
1405,The Apotheosis of Human Incompetence,"If hospitals operated with this degree of incompetence, overpopulation would be a thing of the past."
1406,Rubbish company,"Rubbish company, SWR is unreliable, incredible expensive and they always are on strike."
1407,"Late, cramped, delayed and skipped your station","It's difficult to even explain the depths of failure that this company has achieved. Since taking over from SouthWestTrains, the trains are more cramped and less punctual, which is impressive when you consider that almost every single train used to be late. I've never seen so many cancelled trains before. Now the smart card system has been 'improved', which is why it's no longer possible to actually buy a ticket with a smart card. Now I'm on hold and I'm being flung between 5 seconds of canned music and 2 different adverts for their own services."
1408,Where possible will use someone else from now on,Will try and do anything to swindle you out of money and avoid paying out on delays. I also don't trust the appeals service when I appealed to them regarding money back for delays and appealing a penalty fare seemed very copy and paste like they never bothered to read my appeals
1409,Oxymoron,"When you encounter such unreliable, inconsistent and poorly communicated service as SWR, it would help slightly if you could rely on a reasonably quick (I mean what, 3 days?) response time to queries. But it’s even worse than their train service. I’ve had a holding email after a month!"
1410,I Was Lied To,"I boarded a train in Southampton, unaware that I'd dropped my ticket on the platform and was promptly handed an  £82 penalty fare on arrival. Fair enough. However, the 'revenue officer' assured me that if I could prove that I had purchased a ticket through the appeals service, I wouldn't have to pay."
1411,A poor start to a new franchise,"South Western Railway (who took over the franchise previously held by South West Trains late August 2017) took control of the franchise at an unfortunate time - during extensive engineering works which severely impacted services into London Waterloo station (and, as predicted, overran)."
1412,A constantly stressful experience,"Commuting with London Northwestern has been the most miserable experience of my working life so far. The stress of never knowing whether you will arrive where you need to be on time, and be able to get home again has at times driven me to the verge of tears. Delay repay doesn't make up for this experience. They have a long way to go to start to win any trust back from their (high-paying) customers."
1413,If I could give it no stars I would,"If I could give it no stars I would. Trains are often late, sometimes cancelled, during peak times never enough sits, extortionate prices for the quality provided. Today we had a Polish train manager who was aggressive and rather rude - spoiled my day out in London with her attitude - very poor service."
1414,Shabby old trains,"I can't remember going on trains quite as shabby and dirty as the ones I've travelled on since London Northwestern Railway took over this line. Although I was glad to see the back of London Midland, as service was far from exemplary, after seeing what's arrived to take its place, all I can say is, 'Come back London Midland, we forgive you!'"
1415,A step down from the previous operator…,"A step down from the previous operator (who were already fairly poor).  A nasty ammonia smell from Northampton to London, then a massively overcrowded return service at 23:04 on a Saturday night.  Next time I'll drive to the nearest underground stop."
1416,Poor facilities,"Unfortunately, after this new company took over London Midland no customer surveys or other type of research were conducted. Service issues are the same. For instance, condition of the toilets - smelly, dirty and not fit for use by small children, no belts on the baby change tables, no tissues and no hot water."
1417,Extremely poor,Extremely poor.
1418,Why does this train run sooooo slow?,Why does this train run sooooo slow? It's embarrassing really. I could walk faster than this. Just embarrassing.
1419,The plague of the railway,"Frequent cancellations at short notice, usually due to shortage of crew. Substandard trains that are dirty, smelly, extremely overcrowded and slow. Easily the worst operator on the west coast main line. If you are forced to use lnwrailway then you are in for a sorry experience. This is the company that formed in the wake of London midlands demise, but it is the same staff and the same trains, with the same awful experience. Operators like this gives the railway a bad name."
1420,Very poor service at a very high price,"Very poor service at a very high price. I use this trains to commute to work from Kent to London, starting job at 7am, since the new timetable was introduced the majority of the days the early trains are cancelled with no reason given, forcing the people to rush to get the high speed one, which is a double price, and this happens nearly every day . Bear in mind that the highest fees in the world in terms of public transport are in UK, so why their service is worst than in the 3rd world and the government don't even bother to investigate this scam."
1421,Terrible train seevice,"Since with the new timetable,  I don't have a direct train or a good train connection during the weekend into London Waterloo East from Gillingham Kent."
1422,Worst railway company in the World .,Worst railway company in the World .
1423,Slow and unrelaible.,Super rude staff. Train are delayed almost everyday.
1424,Exceptional service from Rochester staff.,"On arrival at  Rochester station yesterday (28/3/18), the staff automatically asked if we needed a ramp to aid getting my husband on the train. We declined as he is able to get himself in & out of the wheelchair - nevertheless 2 staff arrived on the platform and said they would lift the wheelchair onto the train for me AND phone through to St. Pancras International station to help us at our destination.They were just lovely - it made our day!!!!!!! Thank you so much"
1425,"Normally a good service, sometimes, not.","Normally, their train service is acceptable, expensive, fairly comfortable, even the toilets work (sometimes).  The staff are usually really good, if a bit exasperated (they do not complain, it is just they are often dealing with tricky circumstances); although, sad to say, one guard prompted a complaint for her dictatorial behaviour (guarding an empty First Class on an  overloaded train, the company seems to have changed policies since).  During the recent snow, I am afraid that they failed to provide security and nearly emptied out a train because the horn stopped working, but after 5 minutes of 250 passengers standing puzzled in the snow, they let them reboard and went at 20mph, which was the right thing to do.  Generally, the service is okay.  Sometimes, trains get delayed due to staff not getting to Victoria, there are too many delays but it is the exception rather than the rule.  Looking forward to continued expected improvement."
1426,Worst Company ever,"Worst Company ever, avoid like the plague...oh wait you can't if you have to get a train.  Literally held to ransom by a completely incompetent business."
1427,Even Southeastern tick offices advise …,Even Southeastern ticket offices advise AGAINST using their website.
1428,Well well,"Well well, here I am after the Christmas holidays... After the customer service told me “2018 after the themes link program everything will be sorted” After a 2017 full of delayed and cancelled trains. After accepting (not really) this fare increases over an already crazy amount of money for a really unacceptable service. After the struggles to be at work and at home always late in 2017 and 2016..."
1429,A disgrace of a company.,- Always late
1430,Very disappointing in so many ways.,Very disappointing in so many ways.
1431,just terrible,"always delayed, always overcrowded, way too hot, way too expensive, not to mention useless and incredibly rude ""customer service"" representatives acting like we are there to serve them and not the other way round (i.e. never ask them a question, they always make you feel like you've interrupted their conversation, or daydreaming - what are they there for? never have seen one doing anything, should be removed)."
1432,Waste of paper,"Why does Southeastern provide thick complicate timetable booklets containing all the different branch lines, what a waste of paper!! All most people need is a small folding leaflet for the line we travel on. A leaflet which fits in a purse or wallet. Come on Southeastern go green and do your passengers a favour."
1433,Why can’t something be done about this …,Why can’t something be done about this operator it’s way past a joke
1434,Don't buy a senior railcard a nasty company with robot staff all jobsworth,Don't buy a senior railcard you can't get into London until 11 am discusted the earlier train is an off peak but not if you are going to London.Staff are very rude and nasty let's hope they do lose there jobs .They are happy to run the train empty .If you get to London and return to Kent in the morning you can not board a train until 0930 keep in mind the train is empty and leaves at 0925 so another hour wasted at a station.GO BY COACH MUCH MUCH CHEAPER AND MUCH QUICKER.
1435,Late,"Late, cancelled, signal failures, too much rain, too sunny...these are regular occurrences in Southeastern's lexicon."
1436,Not sure why they even have timetables,"Trains are constantly delayed or cancelled. I am not sure why they even have timetables, since this only raises expectations that there will be some regularity to the service. Commuting with Southeastern Railways means giving up any thought of arriving at a specific time at a specific place."
1437,Helpful guards,"On a yearly basis we take a group of Preschool children from Yalding on a train ride to a park. Taking 20 children on a train is quite stressful but was made so much easier by the lovely guards on both the forward and return trips. We were apologetic that it might take a bit longer to get them all on but they were helpful and funny and the safety of the children was their immediate concern. The trains both ways were also dead on time. I know i am not a regular train user and i can understand the frustration the service can sometimes cause (and the cost!) but on this occassion i wanted to say thank you to all concerned and this is an extremely good ""advert"" as to why the train guards should not be scrapped!"
1438,Often late but clean and decent.,"I travel by them every day. I like their newish trains which are always staffed and kept clean. But there are very often delays, cancellations or you get 6 carriages instead of 12 which is very annoying. Still better than bus."
1439,"Train service has improved, but customer service is dreadful",To start with the positives:
